157	When you have a needle and thread, you love decorating your clothes. Cutting and trimming fabric to make clothes can be a good job, but it is a brilliant way of expressing your uniqueness, charm, and creativity. Words cannot express the sense of accomplishment when you have gathered the necessary materials and produced the desired piece of clothing. First, you need a Tailoring Kit and tailoring materials such as Cloth and Finishing Thread. Refer to a Sewing Pattern to make the clothing you want. The necessary materials will vary depending on the Sewing Pattern to be used. Finishing Thread is used for the final needlework.
158	
159	Poetry and songs are a river of knowledge and wisdom that have been passed down through generations. Every note from an instrument that plays beautiful music is a complete language in itself. Learn this skill if you want to understand the basics of speaking in this language. This skill allows you to play tunes that have captivated many ears and hearts with the melody of an instrument. This is not simply about learning a musical technique, this skill will also reward you with more sentimental and magic-like effects.
160	Resting is an important aspect of your life in Erinn. Make sure to take adequate rest if you want to maintain your health. Especially when you are wounded during a battle and your body is aching, or when you are fatigued from a hard day's work, it is good to know how to take a rest that soothes and restores your body's energy.
161	There are times when you want to create your own music. As with many bards who have made history, learn this skill if you want to express the stories and images of life through your own music. You don't have to just play other people's scores, but can create your own.
162	With this skill, you can explore the nature of songs that contain endless wisdom and magical effects. You can nurture various musical talents by studying music, songs, and poetry. Encompassing a wide spectrum of knowledge from reading and writing scores to the meanings of masterpieces, this skill is a must-have if you desire a more systematic and professional understanding of music.
163	The Town Cry skill is useful when you want to convey a message quickly to everyone. Although shouting at your surroundings to convey a message may be considered primitive by many, producing a loud voice that is far-reaching in real life is neither primitive nor easy. Remember that many great generals and heroes of great renown did not hesitate to use the Town Cry skill.
164	Every night, adventurers sleep in a vast wilderness, making home wherever they may go. The combination of a warm campfire, hunted meat, and a bard's song can dissipate any kind of fatigue. This skill allows you to gather common wooden branches to make a campfire. The campfire will help you recover from fatigue and keep you safe from animals that fear fire.
165	In battle, you often sustain a wound that cannot be easily treated with natural or magical healing. Medical treatment is needed to recover from such a wound and this First Aid skill can help you. You are also able to heal others as well as yourself. If you want to administer it to someone else, make them sit down first before using this skill.
166	Gathering natural resources is the most basic of life skills. You can use this skill to gather lumber, draw water, and mine for minerals. You will even be able to gather wool from sheep and cobwebs from white spiders.
167	Transforming several kinds of materials and combining them to create objects that function in unforeseen ways is a very interesting skill. Such work requires manual dexterity, precise understanding of the materials, and a high level of concentration to make this combination work. However, it is a difficult task to explain the necessity of these elements to someone who wishes to create something. People refer to all of these basic elements as the Craft skill. This skill will help anyone who wishes to make something out of common materials.
168	Although effective in keeping oneself warm, leather garments are constricting and heavy, and many animals need to be hunted to make one. This naturally led to creating lighter garments which can be made in a less dangerous way. The Weaving skill allows you to create thread from natural resources such as wool to weave fabric. In order to learn and effectively use the Weaving skill, you must have an eye for detail and put in your most sincere efforts. While these are difficult criteria to accomplish, knowing that many people are able to create beautiful garments with the fabric that you have weaved using the Weaving skill will be quite fulfilling. Remember that you require tools such as Spinning Wheels and Looms to use the skill.

171	While the ore you unearth is nice and hard, you can't do anything with it if it contains metal, dirt, and sand mixed in it. Not only does it make it difficult to build metal products of adequate quality, it is also difficult to produce even any results. Therefore, in order to use metal, a process in which pure metal is gained from ore is essential. This is where the Refine skill comes in. Through this skill, you can gain pure metal ingots or bars from ore. Do note that you can use this skill only when there is a Furnace to melt the ore in.
172	This skill is required when creating an item by using metal ingots. It involves melting ingots and pouring the ore into a mold, then hammering, heating, and cooling it. Once you thoroughly learn this skill, you can make weapons. But, in order to use this skill, you will need an Anvil to beat the heated metal.
173	You can protect yourself from any attack of the enemy in close-quarter combat by using this Defense skill. Remember that, while Defense is a way to protect your body, it also lets you retaliate. Successfully defending yourself disrupts the enemy's flow of attacks, opening themselves up to your attack. If you determine that you are on the defensive during a battle due to the one-sided attack of the enemy, you can instantly turn the tide of the battle by using this skill. Don't be discouraged even if your enemy does not lose his flow of attack, but persistently lead him on to spend his energy. After tiring out the enemy, administer a quiet and calm strike. Defense is the most effective preparation for your attacks.
174	At your first opportunity, use the Smash skill to nearby enemies. This powerful attack skill will send them flying. If your enemy repeats the cycle of retreating and defending at your coming onslaught, don't hesitate to seize the battle initiative by using a powerful skill like Smash.
175	Making a reverse use of the enemy's force is one of the most fundamental battle strategies against a powerful enemy. The Melee Counterattack skill deals with such reverse use of an enemy's attack. Learning this skill will allow you to maintain a high level of concentration, enabling you to counter any attack from your enemy. With damage in direct proportion to the power of the enemy's attack, Melee Counterattack is an essential skill when battling a powerful enemy.

182	Attacking the enemy from a place where his attacks cannot reach you is the easiest way to defeat an enemy. This is an obvious fact, but it's not so simple during actual battle. In a long range attack, a weapon that enables such an attack and the skill to handle that weapon with precision are critical. Containing the basics of long range attacks, learning Ranged Attack enables you to carry out more accurate and powerful attacks from a distance. However, this one thing must not be forgotten - long range attacks are not accomplished by instant mental understanding but through persistent practice and training. The idea of a battle without risks is appealing, but it also requires much preparation and grueling training.
183	Carrying an immense punch in a single long-range shot - thus delivering great impact that the enemy can't handle - makes this Magnum Shot skill appealing. The enemy wounded by this attack will collapse before they can even approach you. Not only that, even if it only grazes the enemy, this powerful skill will topple the enemy's morale and make them tremble in fear even before starting the battle. If you have reached a point where you can control the tempo in your concentration and the power of your attack, practice delivering a great impact on your target with this skill. This is easier said than done, however.
184	Even for a melee combat master, escaping the attacks of multiple opponents is not an easy task. When dealing with one opponent, you cannot avoid the attacks of another one that takes advantage of the situation. This skill enables you to escape from danger by exchanging a little bit of your life. Knock out the surrounding enemies attacking you and escape. This skill is even more useful when you've been knocked down by successive attacks of your opponents.
185	Stomp description
186	Instinctive Reaction description goes here.
187	Combat Mastery skill is an essential skill for more effective engagement in close-quarter combat. This skill is based on discipline of the body rather than knowledge. With high Combat Mastery skill, you deliver more powerful attacks than someone who is not using this skill. While this skill does not have fancy, conspicuous effects like other skills, it has an automatic, general effect in close-quarter combat.
188	If you learn to strike the weak points on your enemy, it's not so difficult to deliver only a few blows to end a powerful enemy that looks down his nose at you. Although ordinary people attribute such strikes to coincidence, calling it a lucky shot, critical hits don't happen accidentally, no matter how lucky you are. This skill is impossible without careful observations of your enemy and identifying his weakness. The more you train yourself in this skill, the more opportunities you will have in delivering a critical hit.
189	Mana is incredibly precious to someone who practices magic. Generated by receiving the moonlight of Eweca, mana is not even replenished during the day when Eweca is not in sight. But you can use this Meditation skill to put your mind into a state of extreme tranquility, increasing the mana absorption rate.
190	Enchant refers to imbuing magical effects on an item. It is a tragedy to see an expensive scroll turn to dust after a failed attempt at enchanting an item. You can learn this Enchant skill and use the Magic Powder as a catalyst in place of scrolls. Use this skill while holding the Magic Powder in the right hand and the Enchant scroll in the left. Even if your attempt fails, you will not lose the scroll.
191	Enchant refers to imbuing magical effects on an item. It is a tragedy to see an expensive scroll turn to dust after a failed attempt at enchanting an item. You can learn this Enchant skill and use the Magic Powder as a catalyst in place of scrolls. Use this skill while holding the Magic Powder in the right hand and the Enchant scroll in the left. Even if your attempt fails, you will not lose the scroll.
192	Healing magic replenishes HP by using mana which is the fundamental force that makes up this world. Healing magic recovers a certain amount of HP in the target, and this helps to recover the target's energy which was lost due to heavy adventuring. In addition, the power of this magic is strong enough to affect the target as well as the caster. The caster who has finished preparing to cast this magic is protected from external attacks by the power of magic. The effectiveness and the experience points from this magic increase when Life is running low, so proper timing would be helpful. But you must remember this one thing - that the magic only recovers HP, it cannot treat wounds.
193	
194	Using electricity as the medium, this magic creates a small lightning bolt that penetrates the target. While the lightning hits the target in the blink of an eye, the pain inflicted on the target is prolonged. Lightningbolt can be even more powerful when combined with the spells cast by other casters around you. It can also spread from the main target to other nearby enemies. Repeatedly preparing Lightningbolt can reinforce such a chain reaction.
195	This skill involves creating a high-voltage cloud using mana, then fire thunder at unsuspecting enemies. The sheer power of the thunder affects every enemy in the vicinity. Summon the spell multiple times to accumulate more voltage, creating a more powerful thunder.
196	All things are imbued with the heat gifted by the sun. Drawing a little bit of that heat from everywhere and focusing it on a single point turns it into a pure flame, burning around the caster. A fireball created this way can be fired at the will of the caster, and the heat instantly consumes the target upon impact. The more mana you concentrate, the more powerful the Firebolt becomes. That is, reciting the incantation multiple times makes your attack much more powerful.
197	If firebolt is considered the bullet, then fireball is the cannonball of fire-related skills. The fireball is created by spinning fire elemental at a rapid speed around an imaginary center point. Because this ball is created through spinning, creating inertial gravity, it gives off the impression that a very heavy canonball is flying through the air.
198	Icebolt is an offensive spell with ice properties. It uses mana to focus the moisture in the air on one point, rapidly freezing it. The sharp ice shards created through instant freezing are then successively fired at the enemy. Frozen ice shards can cause as much damage as a well-sharpened blade, and they also generate mana and reduce enemy movement speed. While the casting time is long, an Icebolt that has been prepared can be instantly fired at the enemy. It should be assumed that, when there are ice shards revolving around a caster, they can be fired at anytime. These fearsome Icebolts can hit an archer before he draws the bow string, repeatedly attacking the target before the pain has even had a chance to subside.
199	The Ice Spear skill uses MP to gather water particles in the air and turns them into a spear shaped ice.  The ice spear is created above the targeted object to take advantage of its weight and acceleration by the gravity. The ice spear has greater piercing power compared to the ice bolt, and therefore can incur damage over enemies in the surrounding area.

206	근접 전투의 경험자라면 누구나 한번쯤 가져보았을 생각 - 어째서 한번의 스윙으로 한 명의 적 만을 공격할 수 있는가? 라는 의문에서 풀스윙 스킬은 탄생되었다. 팔로우 스윙을 충분히 하여 타겟을 공격한 후에도 충분한 속도를 낼수만 있다면 한번의 스윙으로 여러명의 타겟을 공격하는 것도 불가능하지는 않다. 다만 상당한 스태미나가 뒷받침되지 않는다면 스킬을 사용하는 것 조차 버거울 것이다.
207	스매시의 약점인 느린 공격 속도를 보완한 것이 파이널 스매시이다. 파이널 스매시를 사용하고 적을 공격하면 일반 공격 연타후 마지막 공격으로 스매시를 날린다. 그렇지만, 누구라도 예상할 수 있듯 이 스킬을 사용하는데는 스태미나가 상당히 많이 필요하기 때문에 사용에 주의를 요한다.
208	The Arrow Revolver skill was invented not by archers but wizards. The idea of loading arrows in advance came from charging Icebolts. For beginners, it would be challenging to load even 2 arrows due to the high tension of the bow string. Thus, loading 5 arrows and maintaining that state would seem mysterious and almost magical to beginners.
209	체인건은 다섯발의 화살을 연달아서 발사하는 스킬이다. 이것은 활의 달인들이 여러대의 화살을 미리 활과 함께 쥐고, 첫번째 화살을 발사하면서 그 반작용의 힘을 손목으로 조절하여 두번째 화살을 장전하고 발사한다. 이것을 반복하는 것이 체인건이다. 연달아서 발사하기 위해서 정확한 타겟에의 조준은 포기해야 한다.

218	You can cook with various food ingredients. You can learn recipes through books or NPCs.
219	Herbalism is an essential skill when identifying and gathering herbs in the wilderness. There are exceptional cases of the uninitiated in Herbalism successfully gathering herbs by luck. However, gathering herbs is a very delicate process and beginners in Herbalism can often ruin intact herbs. Rare herbs tend to grow only in the deepest regions of a dungeon and, therefore, you should regularly study the different kinds of herbs and practice a careful gathering skill.
220	Once you know how, creating potions with herbs is not such a difficult skill. But, rare potions require equally rare ingredients, and extra care should be exercised in handling them.
221	Fishing is a useful skill to use when catching fish in the water. You can easily start fishing with a Fishing Rod and Bait, but you need more than that to fish even better. You must know how to adequately attach the Bait, have the judgment to choose a good place, and have the patience to wait until a fish is caught once all the preparation is done. Once fish is caught, you must control the single fishing line and quickly snatch it up as the fish will challenge you with its strength. This is why many people refer to experienced fishermen as the masters of life.

223	The Arrow Revolver skill was invented not by archers but wizards. The idea of loading arrows in advance came from charging Icebolts.

225	자폭스킬(임시)
226	A common mistake even for proficient archers is to be overly confident in the power of his own arrow so that he steps out of line in his supporting role. He would then get in the way of other warriors' battle to death and snatch away their accomplishment. The Support Shot skill allows for the wisdom and discernment to use the bow with the whole battle scene in mind rather than the archer's target. The Support Shot skill is an integral part in the way of a respected archer.
227	A hidden skill used when enchanting with only a scroll
228	A skill that enables one to become a Paladin. A number of character stats will go through a significant boost, while the character will be temporarily equipped with Paladin-only armors. This skill does not last long, however, and it's only available once a day in Erinn time.

238	Handicraft
239	It's very fascinating to use various kinds of materials to create and manipulate items that may have unexpected functions available. In order to do this, one must be equipped with nimble hands, a thorough understanding of the materials, and a high level of concentration required to catch just the right combination of items for maximum effect. Explaining all this to everyone hoping to create something from scratch is a difficult task, however. Adding all these up, people began to call this knowledge the Handicraft skill. To anyone that desires to create something from scratch, this skill may be a godsend.
241	If you have purchased the Handicraft Kit, then you should now read the Handicraft skillbook in detail to acquire the skill. The book can be found in bookstores.

An immensely delicate process that requires a high level of concentration, it is no exaggeration to say that those who are proficient in magic casting are that much closer to the laws that make up this world. The greater the variety of magic learned and used, the greater the general understanding of magic. Under the divine protection of Magic Mastery, the wizard's power and knowledge to control mana will grow deeper.

This is why many people refer to experienced fishermen as the masters of life.
271	Party Healing
275	A spell that simultaneously recovers the HP of your fellow party mates.
278	This skill enhances the senses related to making, which almost all skills in the Making domain commonly possess, with the exception of Cooking and Enchant.
279	Making something, no matter what it is, requires selecting the material, shaping it, and then properly combining them. One who mentally organizes the relationship of parts and how these parts combine to form the resulting product will develop patience and tenacity that he didn't have before. This leads to improved Stamina. Production Mastery is a skill that reflects the heart of the maker. The heart of the maker who imagines the completed product has more delicate skill, and his intense desire and imagination leads to successful incarnation of the result in the real world. Making something or discovering in order to make something is the driving force that develops the Production Mastery skill. (But Enchant seems to be in a separate domain.)
280	Healing is a magical spell that enables one to gather HP for those in need. Party Healing works the same way, except that it not only helps just one other person but all the members of the party to which the person belongs. In theory, Party Healing is very similar to Healing, as both skills can be upgraded to the point of mastery where the spell may provide increased defense from outside attacks, or increased magic attack power as more party members are healed. The one caveat is that the spell only recovers HP and does not help for healing injuries.
281	Magic Mastery
282	Every night, adventurers sleep in a vast wilderness, making home wherever they may go. The combination of a warm campfire, hunted meat, and a bard's song can dissipate any kind of fatigue.

285	The true power of Paladin stems from utilizing the armor that protects his/her body with the aid of nature's innate power. Natural Shield is the skill that allows the Paladin to acquire abilities to defend self from long range attacks, and it's triggered at random when transforming into a Paladin. When this skill is triggered, the Paladin may protect with the power of wind that offer resistance to arrows and other projectiles. Once this skill is triggered, the Paladin will be protected from other projectiles without requiring too much concentration. Of course, this power of wind that offers resistance does not offer 100% bulletproof protection. It only minimizes the damage that can be occurred through arrows and other projectiles by offering a strong resistance.

Heavy Stander is the skill that allows the Paladin to acquire abilities to defend self from melee attacks, and it's triggered at random when transforming into a Paladin. When this skill is triggered, the Paladin may protect self with the power of rock that offer resistance to melee attacks. Sustaining this effect requires an amazingly high level of concentration, so no mere human being can sustain this for too long. Thus, this amazing power is usually stemmed from the power of nature, which means it does not occur by choice. If the effect of this skill is evident when attacked by an enemy, then the damage received from the attack is bounced right off to the enemy, temporarily stunning the enemy for a split second, which will allow for a powerful counterattack.
287	The true power of Paladin stems from utilizing the armor that protects his/her body with the aid of nature's innate power. Mana Deflector is the skill that allows the Paladin to acquire abilities to defend self from magic attacks, and it's triggered at random when transforming into a Paladin. When this skill is triggered, the Paladin may protect with the power of light that offer resistance to lower-leveled magic attacks. Once this skill is triggered, the Paladin will be protected from lower-level magic attacks without requiring too much concentration. Firebolts and other magic skills that offer instant damages cannot be blocked with this skill, however, and it will offer no resistance against mid-leveled spells that require a powerful dose of mana.

328	You don't know it yet. This skill seems to enable you to see the skill of the animals or the Evil Forces when you fight them.
329	Hands of Chaos
334	A skill that enables one to become a Dark Knight. A number of character stats will go through a significant boost, while the character will be temporarily equipped with Dark Knight Armors. If this skill is sustained for longer than the allotted time, the power of darkness will become unbearable and start applying negative pressure to the body. It's only available once a day in Erinn time.
335	This skill strengthens the body by drawing powers from inner darkness. This skill allows one to become a Dark Knight with immense strength and high level of balance.
336	This skill increases the level of intelligence by drawing powers from inner darkness lodged in one's head. This skill allows one to become a Dark Knight with immense intelligence and destructive level of critical hit.
337	This skill strengthens the techniques and skills by drawing powers from inner darkness within one's hands. This skill allows one to become a Dark Knight with immense dexterity and destructive level of injury rate on others.
338	The true power of Dark Knight stems from utilizing the armor that protects his/her body with the aid of one's will. Dark Natural Shield is the skill that's similar to Paladin's Natural Shield, in that it allows Dark Knight to acquire abilities to defend self from long range attacks, and it's triggered at random when transforming into Dark Knight. When this skill is triggered, the Dark Knight may protect with the power of erg that offer resistance to arrows and other projectiles. Once this skill is triggered, the Dark Knight will be protected from other projectiles without requiring too much concentration. Of course, this power of wind that offers resistance does not offer 100% bulletproof protection. It only minimizes the damage that can be occurred through arrows and other projectiles by offering a strong resistance.
339	The true power of Dark Knight stems from utilizing the armor that protects his/her body with the aid of one's will. Dark Heavy Stander is the skill that is similar to Paladin's Heavy Stander in that it allows Dark Knight to acquire abilities to defend from melee attacks, and it's triggered at random when transforming into Dark Knight. When this skill is triggered, the Dark Knight may protect self by instantly strengthening the armor and the muscles that offer resistance to melee attacks. It is a tough task to block out and defend against all the attacks at once, however, which means the skill does not occur by choice, but is triggered at random. If the effect of this skill is evident when attacked by an enemy, then the damage received from the attack is bounced right off to the enemy, temporarily stunning the enemy for a split second, which will allow for a powerful counterattack.
340	다크나이트의 진정한 힘은 인간 내면의 가능성을 최대한으로 끌어내어 자신의 몸을 둘러싼 갑옷에 자신의 의지에 따른 효과를 부여하는 것이다. 다크 마나 리프랙터는 팔라딘의 마나 리프랙터와 같은 효과를 가지는 스킬로서, 다크나이트 변신시에 선택적으로 발동되어 마법 공격에 대한 방어 능력을 얻게 해준다. 이 능력이 발동되면 몸 속에서 발산되는 어둠의 힘이 공격해온 마법의 마나를 먹어 치우듯 흡수해버려 충격과 피해를 대부분 없애버린다. 다만, 마나가 흘러넘치는 중급 마법이나 충격을 주는 데 특화된 파이어 볼트 등의 마법은 다 흡수하지 못하여 그 파괴력을 모두 막아내지는 못한다.
343	From the darkness within, this skill allows you to control animals or Fomors in the vicinity. The more powerful the animal/Fomor you’re trying to tame, the stronger they will resist the skill, but the stronger the skill’s power will have over them once tamed. The more powerful the animal/Fomor, the longer it will do your bidding. This skill requires a special Fomor Scroll, which can be easily obtained from other humans.
344	In order to emerge victorious from a battle, you don't just need strength, but you need accurate judgment carried out at the right time. When you understand this, it becomes valuable to recognize the skill that the enemy is preparing when you first face him. The skill, Sharp Mind, was named by those who understand the value of this skill, and it is no exaggeration to say that knowing how to use this skill adequately is the blessing of Goddess Morrighan. Sharp Mind enables you to read the enemy's movement and see how the enemy will attack you or evade your attack. While it is not so difficult to actually teach or learn this skill, consciously using this skill in a pressing battle seldom happens, and this is the reason why those who are blessed by this skill are envied by those who are not. Even today, many people endeavor to train themselves in this skill through combat.
345	The true power of Dark Knight stems from utilizing the armor that protects his/her body with the aid of one's will. Dark Mana Deflector is just like Paladin's Mana Deflector in that it is the skill that allows the Dark Knight to acquire abilities to defend self from magic attacks, and it's triggered at random when transforming into Dark Knight. When this skill is triggered, the Dark Knight may protect self with the power of darkness that absorbs the mana that is produced in magic attacks, eliminating most of the damage. Firebolts and other magic skills that offer instant damages cannot be blocked with this skill, however, and it cannot absorb all the mana produced from mid-leveled spells and therefore will not be able to block it out.

If an artifact does not appear, try to click on another spot.
412	The action for pretending that you are totally incapacitated. You are just pretending so people will most likely not be fooled all that easily, but if you are actually getting attacked by a monster, this action is worth trying.

421	Final Hit
422	The final hit is an attack skill that is most effective in melee combat which brings down the enemy with crazed force that pushes the body's strength to its limits. You can defeat the enemy by instantaneously moving in the speed of a sword in the air, which allows you to keep swinging your sword even when you are under attack by the enemy as long as you are holding the sword in both hands. If you are holding a weapon in just one hand, you will be able to blow away your enemy with a single swing in the air.
423	A simulating act that allows one to pretend he/she is knocked unconscious. This will not fool the human beings, but try using this skill when knocked to the ground because of a monster attack.

Such effects can even spread to others that are nearby.

440	A skill that allows for loading up the erg of a mirage, which has been developed by using mana, on a bow and shooting. This skill can potentially incur great damages on a multitude of enemies.

The enemy's HP will fall significantly, and infect any others nearby with the same symptoms. As low as the HP may get, however, it will not fall below 1.

782	Mana Shield
783	
785	It creates a powerful protective field using the power of mana in order to defend against enemy attacks. It is effective against both physical attacks and magic attacks. The more understanding you have in using mana, the less mana you will use to defend.
786	While the ore you unearth is nice and hard, you can't do anything with it if it contains metal, dirt, and sand mixed in it. Not only does it make it difficult to build metal products of adequate quality, it is also difficult to produce even any results. Therefore, in order to use metal, a process in which pure metal is gained from ore is essential. This is where the Refine skill comes in. Through this skill, you can gain pure metal ingots or bars from ore. Do note that you can use this skill only when there is a Furnace to melt the ore in.

The Wind Guard can be used with the Taunt skill, which makes it a perfect combo for luring monsters to yourself while being securely protected. It is highly effective against melee and range attack, but it isn't as quite effective against magic attacks.
826	A skill that draws the attention of nearby monsters to yourself. Once an enemy is drawn in, it will solely attack you for a fixed amount of time, so it is a great skill that can be used to help party members who are in danger.  Since it can be used with the Wind Guard skill, it is advantageous to learn them together.

By clicking on a nearby location while holding the Shift button, you can also teleport to that location, dodging an enemy that is about to attack. However, teleporting reduces the skill duration time, so it should be used accordingly.

875	It is said to be the knowledge pertaining to the first half of Alchemy. No other details are known.
876	It is said to be a skill that shoots water from the Cylinder. No other details are known.
877	A skill that stores the powers of magic such as Fireball, Thunder, or Ice Spear, in a crystal. This type of crystal can be used even by those who do not have the related skill, as long as they are equipped with a Cylinder. With higher rank, a better quality crystal can be produced and a shorter amount of time is spent casting when using the Mana Crystal. Although you can use your own magic to perform Mana Crystallization, it’s not recommended because of the difficulty in handling both Alchemy and your own magic simultaneously. (It would ultimately be subpar to using someone else’s magic.)
878	A skill that extracts the ingredient by separating a material into its basic elements. If successful, you can extract an ingredient required to make an item. If you look into making skills such as Weaving, Refining, and Handicraft, you can acquire a hint regarding the item you get when you fragmentize.
879	A skill that synthesizes multiple items to create a new item. The quality of items before you synthesize will determine the quality of items after. Although it's hard to predict item results, you can find synthesis recipes in books on Alchemy, which can teach you how to make exceptional items.
880	An indication of how much knowledge you have gained about Alchemy. Mastery of Alchemy will increase after becoming familiar with all the various known types of Alchemy, not just one type. The material and structural changes aren't easy to follow, but investing the effort to acquire the proper knowledge will result in optimum results in most skills that pertain to Alchemy.
881	A skill that allows you to blast a powerful stream of water using the Water Cannon Crystals in the Cylinder. Spinning at high speeds, the water deals significant damage and knocks down nearby opponents. (Opponents at a distance will only incur minor damage and will not be knocked down.) You can insert up to 5 crystals at a time, which could be shot all at once if the situation demands.

888	An innovative Alchemy skill that can create Golems by structurally changing the inside of a stone. This ancient skill developed by Fomor Alchemists was previously inimitable by terrestrial races until recent times. This process is many times more intricate than controlling a Golem.
893	A skill that allows you to blast a powerful stream of water by inserting Water Crystals in the Cylinder. Spinning at high speeds, the water deals significant damage and knocks down nearby opponents. (Opponents at a distance will only incur minor damage and will not be knocked down.) You can insert up to 5 crystals at a time, which could be shot all at once if the situation demands.
894	A skill that uses a steam oven to crystalize the power of magic such as Fireball, Thunder, or Ice Spear. These crystals can be used by anyone who is equipped with a Cylinder. At higher ranks, better-quality crystals can be produced and a shorter amount of time is spent casting when using the Mana Crystal. Although you can use your own magic to perform Mana Crystallization, it's not recommended because of the difficulty of handling both Alchemy and your own magic simultaneously. (Using someone else's magic will produce superior results.)
895	A skill that extracts the ingredient after fragmentizing a material in a dry oven. If you look into making skills such as Weaving, Refining, and Handicraft, you can acquire a hint regarding the item you get when you fragmentize.
896	A skill that produces a new item by synthesizing multiple items in a dry oven. The quality of items before you synthesize will determine the quality of items after.

In theory, Party Healing is very similar to Healing, as both skills can be upgraded to the point of mastery where the spell may provide increased defense from outside attacks, or increased magic attack power as more party members are healed. The one caveat is that the spell only recovers HP and does not help for healing injuries.

Only when enough energy has been gathered can this skill then be activated.

2890	Battlefield Overture
2891	Lullaby
2892	Vivace
2893	Enduring Melody
2894	Harvest Song
2895	March Song
2902	As history marched on, the Bards couldn't help but be dragged into Erinn's many wars. The songs they played to enhearten their comrades was passed along through the generations, and now these same songs are used to boost morale before a big battle. Thus, these songs earned the title Battlefield Overture.
2904	Vivace is a musical term that means 'fast tempo.' Magicians discovered that Vivace music increased the speed with which they thought, and after some experimentation, they learned that Vivace music could be used to speed up Alchemists, Warriors, and Rangers, too.
2905	Music not only uplifts the soul, but the mind and body as well. A well-played Enduring Melody can even harden defenses and restore energy.
2906	Nothing makes the workday go by more quickly like a good song. During the long months of planting and harvesting, Bards developed a series of tunes that would uplift the workers' spirits and improve their crops. These songs came to be known as Harvest Songs.
2907	Carry a jaunty tune in your heart, and your footsteps become lighter. This is the concept behind the March Song--an energetic, cheerful melody that helps the Bard and his companions travel across the land more quickly.
2908	The Final Shot is a powerful ranged skill that sharpens your senses and lets you fire arrows at an extremely high velocity.  It also boosts the aiming speed of your ranged skills and allows you to take an opponent's arrows without staggering or getting knocked down. By clicking on a nearby location while holding the Shift key, you can also teleport to that location, dodging an enemy that is about to attack. However, teleporting reduces the skill duration, so it should be used carefully.

2917	An excellent Bard can use anything as an instrument, whether it's a weapon, a tool, or a monster's body. By striking an enemy just so, a Bard can use the instrument's resonance fill the enemy's being and spread out. Many well-mannered Bards refuse to do this, but others are exhilarated by the feeling of this resonance. Their targets are thrown into shock, and experience waves of pain as the blow continues to resonate through them.

2953	Lullabies are usually reserved for the ones you love; a true Bard can play a Lullaby for his worst enemy. In fact, enemies who hear the Lullaby can fall asleep in an instant, making it a useful song to play in a fight. Sleeping enemies are more sensitive to damage, but they won't stay asleep for long. Unfortunately, stronger enemies are more difficult to put to sleep.

4360	This spell releases arrows of lightning. Not much is known about this spell.
4361	Using electricity as the medium, this magic creates a small lightning bolt that penetrates the target. While the lightning hits the target in the blink of an eye, the pain inflicted on the target is prolonged. Lightning bolt can be even more powerful when combined with the spells cast by other casters around you. It can also spread from the main target to other nearby enemies. Repeatedly preparing Lightning Bolt can reinforce such a chain reaction. Enhancement effects will be added to the maximum charge.

4367	This magic spell releases stinging ice shards. Not much is known about this spell.
4368	Icebolt is an offensive spell with ice properties. It uses mana to focus the moisture in the air on one point, rapidly freezing it. The sharp ice shards created through instant freezing are then successively fired at the enemy. Frozen ice shards can cause as much damage as a well-sharpened blade, and they also generate mana and reduce enemy movement speed. While the casting time is long, an Icebolt that has been prepared can be instantly fired at the enemy. It should be assumed that, when there are ice shards revolving around a caster, they can be fired at anytime. These fearsome Icebolts can hit an archer before he draws the bow string, repeatedly attacking the target before the pain has even had a chance to subside.

4408	Ranald gave you a book of Defense techniques after you ran an errand for him. With the knowledge it contains, you should be able to protect yourself.
4409	Counterattack allows you to turn your opponent's strength against them. This skill will greatly increase your abilities in close-range combat, as you'll be able to reflect almost any attack. The stronger your enemy's attack, the stronger your counterattack becomes. When you're equipped with knuckles, which are usually used by Fighters, you can attack with more agility.
4410	You can protect yourself from any attack of the enemy in close-quarter combat by using this Defense skill. Remember that, while Defense is a way to protect your body, it also lets you retaliate. Successfully defending yourself disrupts the enemy's flow of attacks, opening themselves up to your attack. If you determine that you are on the defensive during a battle due to the one-sided attack of the enemy, you can instantly turn the tide of the battle by using this skill. Don't be discouraged even if your enemy does not lose his flow of attack, but persistently lead him on to spend his energy. After tiring out the enemy, administer a quiet and calm strike. Defense is the most effective preparation for your attacks.
