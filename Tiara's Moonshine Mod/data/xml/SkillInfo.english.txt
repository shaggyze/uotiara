157	When you have a needle and thread, you love decorating your clothes. Cutting and trimming fabric to make clothes can be a good job, but it is a brilliant way of expressing your uniqueness, charm, and creativity. Words cannot express the sense of accomplishment when you have gathered the necessary materials and produced the desired piece of clothing. First, you need a Tailoring Kit and tailoring materials such as Cloth and Finishing Thread. Refer to a Sewing Pattern to make the clothing you want. The necessary materials will vary depending on the Sewing Pattern to be used. Finishing Thread is used for the final needlework.
158	
159	Poetry and songs are a river of knowledge and wisdom that have been passed down through generations. Every note that leaps forth from an instrument speaks in that most universal of languages. Learn this skill if you want to understand the basics of musical theory and performance. This skill allows you to play tunes that have captivated many ears and hearts with instrumental melodies. It is not simply about learning musical technique; this skill will also reward you with more sentimental and magic-like effects.
160	Resting is an important aspect of your life in Erinn. Make sure to take adequate rest if you want to maintain your health. Especially when you are wounded during a battle and your body is aching, or when you are fatigued from a hard day's work, it is good to know how to take a rest that soothes and restores your body's energy.
161	There are times when you want to create your own music. As with many bards who have made history, learn this skill if you want to express the stories and images of life through your own music. You don't have to just play other people's scores, but can create your own.
162	With this skill, you can explore the nature of songs that contain endless wisdom and magical effects. You can nurture various musical talents by studying music, songs, and poetry. Encompassing a wide spectrum of knowledge from reading and writing scores to the meanings of masterpieces, this skill is a must-have if you desire a more systematic and professional understanding of music.
163	The Town Cry skill is useful when you want to convey a message quickly to everyone. Although shouting at your surroundings to convey a message may be considered primitive by many, producing a loud voice that is far-reaching in real life is neither primitive nor easy. Remember that many great generals and heroes of great renown did not hesitate to use the Town Cry skill.
164	Every night, adventurers sleep in a vast wilderness, making home wherever they may go. The combination of a warm campfire, hunted meat, and a bard's song can dissipate any kind of fatigue. This skill allows you to gather common wooden branches to make a campfire. The campfire will help you recover from fatigue and keep you safe from animals that fear fire.
165	In battle, you often sustain a wound that cannot be easily treated with natural or magical healing. Medical treatment is needed to recover from such a wound and this First Aid skill can help you. You are also able to heal others as well as yourself. If you want to administer it to someone else, make them sit down first before using this skill.
166	Gathering natural resources is the most basic of life skills. You can use this skill to gather lumber, draw water, and mine for minerals. You will even be able to gather wool from sheep and cobwebs from white spiders.
167	Transforming several kinds of materials and combining them to create objects that function in unforeseen ways is a very interesting skill. Such work requires manual dexterity, precise understanding of the materials, and a high level of concentration to make this combination work. However, it is a difficult task to explain the necessity of these elements to someone who wishes to create something. People refer to all of these basic elements as the Craft skill. This skill will help anyone who wishes to make something out of common materials.
168	Although effective in keeping oneself warm, leather garments are constricting and heavy, and many animals need to be hunted to make one. This naturally led to creating lighter garments which can be made in a less dangerous way. The Weaving skill allows you to create thread from natural resources such as wool to weave fabric. In order to learn and effectively use the Weaving skill, you must have an eye for detail and put in your most sincere efforts. While these are difficult criteria to accomplish, knowing that many people are able to create beautiful garments with the fabric that you have weaved using the Weaving skill will be quite fulfilling. Remember that you require tools such as Spinning Wheels and Looms to use the skill.

171	While the ore you unearth is nice and hard, you can't do anything with it if it contains metal, dirt, and sand mixed in it. Not only does it make it difficult to build metal products of adequate quality, it is also difficult to produce even any results. Therefore, in order to use metal, a process in which pure metal is gained from ore is essential. This is where the Refine skill comes in. Through this skill, you can gain pure metal ingots or bars from ore. Do note that you can use this skill only when there is a Furnace to melt the ore in.
172	This skill is required when creating an item by using metal ingots. It involves melting ingots and pouring the ore into a mold, then hammering, heating, and cooling it. Once you thoroughly learn this skill, you can make weapons. But, in order to use this skill, you will need an Anvil to beat the heated metal.
173	You can protect yourself from any attack of the enemy in close-quarter combat by using this Defense skill. Remember that, while Defense is a way to protect your body, it also lets you retaliate. Successfully defending yourself disrupts the enemy's flow of attacks, opening themselves up to your attack. If you determine that you are on the defensive during a battle due to the one-sided attack of the enemy, you can instantly turn the tide of the battle by using this skill. Don't be discouraged even if your enemy does not lose his flow of attack, but persistently lead him on to spend his energy. After tiring out the enemy, administer a quiet and calm strike. Defense is the most effective preparation for your attacks.
174	At your first opportunity, use the Smash skill to nearby enemies. This powerful attack skill will send them flying. If your enemy repeats the cycle of retreating and defending at your coming onslaught, don't hesitate to seize the battle initiative by using a powerful skill like Smash.
175	Making a reverse use of the enemy's force is one of the most fundamental battle strategies against a powerful enemy. The Melee Counterattack skill deals with such reverse use of an enemy's attack. Learning this skill will allow you to maintain a high level of concentration, enabling you to counter any attack from your enemy. With damage in direct proportion to the power of the enemy's attack, Melee Counterattack is an essential skill when battling a powerful enemy.

182	Attacking the enemy from a place where his attacks cannot reach you is the easiest way to defeat an enemy. This is an obvious fact, but it's not so simple during actual battle. In a long range attack, a weapon that enables such an attack and the skill to handle that weapon with precision are critical. Containing the basics of long range attacks, learning Ranged Attack enables you to carry out more accurate and powerful attacks from a distance. However, this one thing must not be forgotten - long range attacks are not accomplished by instant mental understanding but through persistent practice and training. The idea of a battle without risks is appealing, but it also requires much preparation and grueling training.
183	Carrying an immense punch in a single long-range shot - thus delivering great impact that the enemy can't handle - makes this Magnum Shot skill appealing. The enemy wounded by this attack will collapse before they can even approach you. Not only that, even if it only grazes the enemy, this powerful skill will topple the enemy's morale and make them tremble in fear even before starting the battle. If you have reached a point where you can control the tempo in your concentration and the power of your attack, practice delivering a great impact on your target with this skill. This is easier said than done, however.
184	Even for a melee combat master, escaping the attacks of multiple opponents is not an easy task. When dealing with one opponent, you cannot avoid the attacks of another one that takes advantage of the situation. This skill enables you to escape from danger by exchanging a little bit of your life. Knock out the surrounding enemies attacking you and escape. This skill is even more useful when you've been knocked down by successive attacks of your opponents.
185	Stomp description
186	Instinctive Reaction description goes here.
187	Combat Mastery skill is an essential skill for more effective engagement in close-quarter combat. This skill is based on discipline of the body rather than knowledge. With high Combat Mastery skill, you deliver more powerful attacks than someone who is not using this skill. While this skill does not have fancy, conspicuous effects like other skills, it has an automatic, general effect in close-quarter combat.
188	If you learn to strike the weak points on your enemy, it's not so difficult to deliver only a few blows to end a powerful enemy that looks down his nose at you. Although ordinary people attribute such strikes to coincidence, calling it a lucky shot, critical hits don't happen accidentally, no matter how lucky you are. This skill is impossible without careful observations of your enemy and identifying his weakness. The more you train yourself in this skill, the more opportunities you will have in delivering a critical hit.
189	Mana is incredibly precious to someone who practices magic. Generated by receiving the moonlight of Eweca, mana is not even replenished during the day when Eweca is not in sight. But you can use this Meditation skill to put your mind into a state of extreme tranquility, increasing the mana absorption rate.
190	Enchant refers to imbuing magical effects on an item. It is a tragedy to see an expensive scroll turn to dust after a failed attempt at enchanting. You can learn this Enchant skill and use the Magic Powder as a catalyst in place of scrolls. Use the skill while holding the Magic Powder in the right hand and the Enchant scroll in the left. Even if you don't equip it, you can attempt at enchanting immediately by using the Enchant skill. If you choose to protect the Enchant Scroll, only the item will be damaged if the enchant fails. On the other hand, if you choose to protect the item, only the Enchant Scroll will be destroyed.

On the other hand, if you choose to protect the item, only the Enchant Scroll will be destroyed.
192	Healing magic replenishes HP by using mana which is the fundamental force that makes up this world. Healing magic recovers a certain amount of HP in the target, and this helps to recover the target's energy which was lost due to heavy adventuring. In addition, the power of this magic is strong enough to affect the target as well as the caster. The caster who has finished preparing to cast this magic is protected from external attacks by the power of magic. The effectiveness and the experience points from this magic increase when Life is running low, so proper timing would be helpful. But you must remember this one thing - that the magic only recovers HP, it cannot treat wounds.
193	
194	Using electricity as the medium, this magic creates a small lightning bolt that penetrates the target. While the lightning hits the target in the blink of an eye, the pain inflicted on the target is prolonged. Lightningbolt can be even more powerful when combined with the spells cast by other casters around you. It can also spread from the main target to other nearby enemies. Repeatedly preparing Lightningbolt can reinforce such a chain reaction.
195	This skill involves creating a high-voltage cloud using mana, then fire thunder at unsuspecting enemies. The sheer power of the thunder affects every enemy in the vicinity. Summon the spell multiple times to accumulate more voltage, creating a more powerful thunder.
196	All things are imbued with the heat gifted by the sun. Drawing a little bit of that heat from everywhere and focusing it on a single point turns it into a pure flame, burning around the caster. A fireball created this way can be fired at the will of the caster, and the heat instantly consumes the target upon impact. The more mana you concentrate, the more powerful the Firebolt becomes. That is, reciting the incantation multiple times makes your attack much more powerful.
197	If firebolt is considered the bullet, then fireball is the cannonball of fire-related skills. The fireball is created by spinning fire elemental at a rapid speed around an imaginary center point. Because this ball is created through spinning, creating inertial gravity, it gives off the impression that a very heavy canonball is flying through the air.
198	Icebolt is an offensive spell with ice properties. It uses mana to focus the moisture in the air on one point, rapidly freezing it. The sharp ice shards created through instant freezing are then successively fired at the enemy. Frozen ice shards can cause as much damage as a well-sharpened blade, and they also generate mana and reduce enemy movement speed. While the casting time is long, an Icebolt that has been prepared can be instantly fired at the enemy. It should be assumed that, when there are ice shards revolving around a caster, they can be fired at anytime. These fearsome Icebolts can hit an archer before he draws the bow string, repeatedly attacking the target before the pain has even had a chance to subside.
199	The Ice Spear skill uses MP to gather water particles in the air and turns them into a spear shaped ice.  The ice spear is created above the targeted object to take advantage of its weight and acceleration by the gravity. The ice spear has greater piercing power compared to the ice bolt, and therefore can incur damage over enemies in the surrounding area.

206	근접 전투의 경험자라면 누구나 한번쯤 가져보았을 생각 - 어째서 한번의 스윙으로 한 명의 적 만을 공격할 수 있는가? 라는 의문에서 풀스윙 스킬은 탄생되었다. 팔로우 스윙을 충분히 하여 타겟을 공격한 후에도 충분한 속도를 낼수만 있다면 한번의 스윙으로 여러명의 타겟을 공격하는 것도 불가능하지는 않다. 다만 상당한 스태미나가 뒷받침되지 않는다면 스킬을 사용하는 것 조차 버거울 것이다.
207	스매시의 약점인 느린 공격 속도를 보완한 것이 파이널 스매시이다. 파이널 스매시를 사용하고 적을 공격하면 일반 공격 연타후 마지막 공격으로 스매시를 날린다. 그렇지만, 누구라도 예상할 수 있듯 이 스킬을 사용하는데는 스태미나가 상당히 많이 필요하기 때문에 사용에 주의를 요한다.
208	The Arrow Revolver skill was invented not by archers but wizards. The idea of loading arrows in advance came from charging Icebolts. For beginners, it would be challenging to load even 2 arrows due to the high tension of the bow string. Thus, loading 5 arrows and maintaining that state would seem mysterious and almost magical to beginners.
209	체인건은 다섯발의 화살을 연달아서 발사하는 스킬이다. 이것은 활의 달인들이 여러대의 화살을 미리 활과 함께 쥐고, 첫번째 화살을 발사하면서 그 반작용의 힘을 손목으로 조절하여 두번째 화살을 장전하고 발사한다. 이것을 반복하는 것이 체인건이다. 연달아서 발사하기 위해서 정확한 타겟에의 조준은 포기해야 한다.

218	You can cook with various food ingredients. You can learn recipes through books or NPCs.
219	Herbalism is an essential skill when identifying and gathering herbs in the wilderness. There are exceptional cases of the uninitiated in Herbalism successfully gathering herbs by luck. However, gathering herbs is a very delicate process and beginners in Herbalism can often ruin intact herbs. Rare herbs tend to grow only in the deepest regions of a dungeon and, therefore, you should regularly study the different kinds of herbs and practice a careful gathering skill.
220	Once you know how, creating potions with herbs is not such a difficult skill. But, rare potions require equally rare ingredients, and extra care should be exercised in handling them.
221	Fishing is a useful skill to use when catching fish in the water. You can easily start fishing with a Fishing Rod and Bait, but you need more than that to fish even better. You must know how to adequately attach the Bait, have the judgment to choose a good place, and have the patience to wait until a fish is caught once all the preparation is done. Once fish is caught, you must control the single fishing line and quickly snatch it up as the fish will challenge you with its strength. This is why many people refer to experienced fishermen as the masters of life.

223	The Arrow Revolver skill was invented not by archers but wizards. The idea of loading arrows in advance came from charging Icebolts.

225	자폭스킬(임시)
226	A common mistake even for proficient archers is to be overly confident in the power of his own arrow so that he steps out of line in his supporting role. He would then get in the way of other warriors' battle to death and snatch away their accomplishment. The Support Shot skill allows for the wisdom and discernment to use the bow with the whole battle scene in mind rather than the archer's target. The Support Shot skill is an integral part in the way of a respected archer.
227	A hidden skill used when enchanting with only a scroll
228	A skill that enables one to become a Paladin. A number of character stats will go through a significant boost, while the character will be temporarily equipped with Paladin-only armors. This skill does not last long, however, and it's only available once a day in Erinn time.

238	Handicraft
239	It's very fascinating to use various kinds of materials to create and manipulate items that may have unexpected functions available. In order to do this, one must be equipped with nimble hands, a thorough understanding of the materials, and a high level of concentration required to catch just the right combination of items for maximum effect. Explaining all this to everyone hoping to create something from scratch is a difficult task, however. Adding all these up, people began to call this knowledge the Handicraft skill. To anyone that desires to create something from scratch, this skill may be a godsend.
241	If you have purchased the Handicraft Kit, then you should now read the Handicraft skillbook in detail to acquire the skill. The book can be found in bookstores.

257	Magic is a way of resonating mana that exists in this world with nature, manipulating it with the powers of the caster. An immensely delicate process that requires a high level of concentration, it is no exaggeration to say that those who are proficient in magic casting are that much closer to the laws that make up this world. The greater the variety of magic learned and used, the greater the general understanding of magic. Under the divine protection of Magic Mastery, the wizard's power and knowledge to control mana will grow deeper.

This is why many people refer to experienced fishermen as the masters of life.
271	Party Healing
275	A spell that simultaneously recovers the HP of your fellow party mates.
278	This skill enhances the senses related to making, which almost all skills in the Making domain commonly possess, with the exception of Cooking and Enchant.
279	Making something, no matter what it is, requires selecting the material, shaping it, and then properly combining them. One who mentally organizes the relationship of parts and how these parts combine to form the resulting product will develop patience and tenacity that he didn't have before. This leads to improved Stamina. Production Mastery is a skill that reflects the heart of the maker. The heart of the maker who imagines the completed product has more delicate skill, and his intense desire and imagination leads to successful incarnation of the result in the real world. Making something or discovering in order to make something is the driving force that develops the Production Mastery skill. (But Enchant seems to be in a separate domain.)
280	Healing is a magical spell that enables one to gather HP for those in need. Party Healing works the same way, except that it not only helps just one other person but all the members of the party to which the person belongs. In theory, Party Healing is very similar to Healing, as both skills can be upgraded to the point of mastery where the spell may provide increased defense from outside attacks, or increased magic attack power as more party members are healed. The one caveat is that the spell only recovers HP and does not help for healing injuries.
281	Magic Mastery
282	Every night, adventurers sleep in a vast wilderness, making their home wherever they may go. The combination of a warm campfire, freshly hunted game, and a bard's song can dissipate any kind of fatigue. This skill allows you to gather common Firewood to make a campfire. This campfire will help you recover from fatigue and keep you safe from animals that fear fire.\n\nWhen performing an Enchanter's Burn on an item at a Campfire, there is a chance to obtain one, both, or none of the Enchant Scrolls. In any attempt, the item will be destroyed, unless the item is protected using an Enchant Extraction Protection Potion. In order to extract an Enchant, you'll need a Mana Herb and a Holy Water of Lymilark.

285	A Paladin's power is made manifest in the armor they wear, suffused with nature's power to guard the body from harm. Natural Shield is a boon that allows Paladins to ward against long-range attacks, sustained for as long as the Paladin transformation is maintained. The Natural Shield calls upon the power of wind to dampen the efficacy of arrows and other projectiles, defending the Paladin without an undue burden upon their concentration. Of course, few wards offer complete immunity, and so it is with the Natural Shield. While one will still incur some degree of damage, the dampening force generated does mitigate a great deal of the harm that would otherwise be sustained from ranged attacks.
286	A Paladin's power is made manifest in the armor they wear, suffused with nature's power to guard the body from harm. Heavy Stander is a stance that allows Paladins to ward against melee attacks, sustained for as long as the Paladin transformation is maintained. The Heavy Stander stance calls upon the power of earth and stone to dampen the efficacy of all manner of physical assault, defending the Paladin without an undue burden upon their concentration. When rooted in the sure guard of the Heavy Stander stance, the damage and recoil from enemy attacks will be reflected back at foes, leaving them temporarily stunned and creating opportunities for powerful counterattacks.
287	A Paladin's power is made manifest in the armor they wear, suffused with nature's power to guard the body from harm. Mana Deflector is a boon that allows Paladins to ward against harmful magics, sustained for as long as the Paladin transformation is maintained. The Mana Deflector field calls upon the power of light to dampen the efficacy of basic magic attacks without an undue burden upon the user's concentration. However, even with Mana Deflector active, elementary magic such as Firebolt will still retain is power to stun and knock back, and the field's dampening properties will do little against intermediate magics that are cast through a powerful channeling of mana.

327	싸움에서 이기기 위해 필요한 것은 무조건적인 힘이 아니라, 적절한 시점에 행사되는 정확한 판단력이다. 이 사실을 알게 되었을 때 적과 맞서는 순간 상대방이 준비하는 스킬을 알아보는 것은 가치 있는 일이 된다. 샤프 마인드라는 이름은 그렇게 이 스킬의 가치를 아는 사람들에 의해서 붙여진 것으로, 이 스킬을 적절히 사용할 줄 안다는 것은 모리안 여신의 축복이라 해도 지나친 말이 아니다. 샤프 마인드 스킬은 상대방의 낌새를 느끼고, 상대방이 자신을 어떤 방법으로 공격하거나 자신의 공격을 피할 것이냐를 꿰뚫어볼 수 있게 해준다. 실제로 가르치거나 배우는 것은 그다지 어려운 일은 아니지만, 급박한 싸움에서 의식적으로 이 스킬을 사용할 수 있는 경우는 거의 없다. 이 스킬의 축복을 받은 사람이 그렇지 못한 사람으로부터 부러움을 사는 것은 이러한 이유로, 오늘도 많은 사람들이 전투를 통해 이 스킬을 연마하고자 힘쓴다.

334	A skill that enables one to become a Dark Knight. A number of character stats will go through a significant boost, while the character will be temporarily equipped with Dark Knight Armors. If this skill is sustained for longer than the allotted time, the power of darkness will become unbearable and start applying negative pressure to the body. It's only available once a day in Erinn time.
335	This skill strengthens the body by drawing powers from inner darkness. This skill allows one to become a Dark Knight with immense strength and high level of balance.
336	This skill increases the level of intelligence by drawing powers from inner darkness lodged in one's head. This skill allows one to become a Dark Knight with immense intelligence and destructive level of critical hit.
337	This skill strengthens the techniques and skills by drawing powers from inner darkness within one's hands. This skill allows one to become a Dark Knight with immense dexterity and destructive level of injury rate on others.
338	A Dark Knight's power is made manifest in the armor they wear, offering peerless protection through the fortification of one's unbending will. Dark Natural Shield, like a Paladin's Natural Shield, is a boon that allows Dark Knights to ward against long-range attacks, sustained for as long as the Dark Knight transformation is maintained. The Dark Natural Shield draws upon the power of Erg to project a field that dampens the efficacy of arrows and other projectiles, defending the Dark Knight without an undue burden upon their concentration. Of course, few wards offer complete immunity, and so it is with the Natural Shield. While one will still incur some degree of damage, the dampening force generated does mitigate a great deal of the harm that would otherwise be sustained from ranged attacks.
339	A Dark Knight's power is made manifest in the armor they wear, offering peerless protection through the fortification of one's unbending will. Dark Heavy Stander, like a Paladin's Heavy Stander, is a stance that allows Dark Knights to ward against melee attacks, sustained for as long as the Dark Knight transformation is maintained. The Heavy Stander stance acts by reinforcing the wearers muscle and bone, as well as the armor itself, to dampen the efficacy of all manner of physical assault, defending the Dark Knight without an undue burden upon their concentration. When rooted in the sure guard of the Heavy Stander stance, the damage and recoil from enemy attacks will be reflected back at foes, leaving them temporarily stunned and creating opportunities for powerful counterattacks.
340	다크나이트의 진정한 힘은 인간 내면의 가능성을 최대한으로 끌어내어 자신의 몸을 둘러싼 갑옷에 자신의 의지에 따른 효과를 부여하는 것이다. 다크 마나 리프랙터는 팔라딘의 마나 리프랙터와 같은 효과를 가지는 스킬로서, 다크나이트 변신시에 선택적으로 발동되어 마법 공격에 대한 방어 능력을 얻게 해준다. 이 능력이 발동되면 몸 속에서 발산되는 어둠의 힘이 공격해온 마법의 마나를 먹어 치우듯 흡수해버려 충격과 피해를 대부분 없애버린다. 다만, 마나가 흘러넘치는 중급 마법이나 충격을 주는 데 특화된 파이어 볼트 등의 마법은 다 흡수하지 못하여 그 파괴력을 모두 막아내지는 못한다.
343	From the darkness within, this skill allows you to control animals or Fomors in the vicinity. The more powerful the animal/Fomor you’re trying to tame, the stronger they will resist the skill, but the stronger the skill’s power will have over them once tamed. The more powerful the animal/Fomor, the longer it will do your bidding. This skill requires a special Fomor Scroll, which can be easily obtained from other humans.
344	In order to emerge victorious from a battle, you don't just need strength, but you need accurate judgment carried out at the right time. When you understand this, it becomes valuable to recognize the skill that the enemy is preparing when you first face him. The skill, Sharp Mind, was named by those who understand the value of this skill, and it is no exaggeration to say that knowing how to use this skill adequately is the blessing of Goddess Morrighan. Sharp Mind enables you to read the enemy's movement and see how the enemy will attack you or evade your attack. While it is not so difficult to actually teach or learn this skill, consciously using this skill in a pressing battle seldom happens, and this is the reason why those who are blessed by this skill are envied by those who are not. Even today, many people endeavor to train themselves in this skill through combat.
345	A Dark Knight's power is made manifest in the armor they wear, offering peerless protection through the fortification of one's unbending will. Dark Mana Deflector, like a Paladin's Mana Deflector, is a boon that allows Dark Knights to warda gainst harmful magics, sustained for as long as the Dark Knight transformation is maintained. The Dark Mana Deflector field calls upon the power of darkness to absorb the mana of a magical assault, dampening the efficacy of basic magic attacks without an undue burden upon the user's concentration. However, even with Dark Mana Deflector active, elementary magic such as Firebolt will still retain is power to stun and knock back, and the field cannot absorb all the mana used in the casting of intermediate magics, and is therefore unable to guard against them effectively.

If an artifact does not appear, try to click on another spot.
412	The action for pretending that you are totally incapacitated. You are just pretending so people will most likely not be fooled all that easily, but if you are actually getting attacked by a monster, this action is worth trying. Just pretend that you are dead and lie there still for a while. You may actually fool the monster afterall, which may, in the end, save your life.

421	Final Hit
422	The final hit is an attack skill that is most effective in melee combat which brings down the enemy with crazed force that pushes the body's strength to its limits. You can defeat the enemy by instantaneously moving in the speed of a sword in the air, which allows you to keep swinging your sword even when you are under attack by the enemy as long as you are holding the sword in both hands. If you are holding a weapon in just one hand, you will be able to blow away your enemy with a single swing in the air.
423	A simulating act that allows one to pretend he/she is knocked unconscious. This will not fool the human beings, but try using this skill when knocked to the ground because of a monster attack. Use the skill to lie still for a prolonged period of time. This will eventually fool the monster to fall for it and leave the area, avoiding further damage.

433	An attack skill that allows for combining the powers of various elements such as electricity, fire and ice, and to load it up and shoot out on a bow. May seem like its direct attack powers are relatively low, but an enemy who has been attacked by this skill once will notice a significant drain in HP, bringing the enemy down to near complete incapacitation. Such effects can even spread to others that are nearby.

440	A skill that allows for loading up the erg of a mirage, which has been developed by using mana, on a bow and shooting. This skill can potentially incur great damages on a multitude of enemies. The enemy that is hit with the mirage missile falls into a kind of shock state, as if fallen into a mirage in the middle of a sandy desert. The enemy's HP will fall significantly, and infect any others nearby with the same symptoms. As low as the HP may get, however, it will not fall below 1.

This does not, of course, render one wholly immune to harm from arrows. Rather, it greatly dampens the force of arrows and other ranged attacks, reducing the damage sustained and making it far less likely that one will be stunned or knocked down by such attacks.

782	Mana Shield
783	
785	It creates a powerful protective field using the power of mana in order to defend against enemy attacks. It is effective against both physical attacks and magic attacks. The more understanding you have in using mana, the less mana you will use to defend.
786	While the ore you unearth is nice and hard, you can't do anything with it if it contains metal, dirt, and sand mixed in it. Not only does it make it difficult to build metal products of adequate quality, it is also difficult to produce even any results. Therefore, in order to use metal, a process in which pure metal is gained from ore is essential. This is where the Refine skill comes in. Through this skill, you can gain pure metal ingots or bars from ore. Do note that you can use this skill only when there is a Furnace to melt the ore in.

823	A skill that surrounds you with a gust of wind that defends against an enemy's attack. While you won't get knocked down, you are also immobile while the skill is being activated. The Wind Guard can be used with the Taunt skill, which makes it a perfect combo for luring monsters to yourself while being securely protected. It is highly effective against melee and range attack, but it isn't as quite effective against magic attacks.
826	A skill that draws the attention of nearby monsters to yourself. Once an enemy is drawn in, it will solely attack you for a fixed amount of time, so it is a great skill that can be used to help party members who are in danger.  Since it can be used with the Wind Guard skill, it is advantageous to learn them together.

It also accelerates the charge speed of the range skill and allows you to take an opponent's arrow attack without experiencing delay or getting knocked down. By clicking on a nearby location while holding the Shift button, you can also teleport to that location, dodging an enemy that is about to attack. However, teleporting reduces the skill duration time, so it should be used accordingly.

874	It is said to combine multiple items to produce a new item. No other details are known.
875	It is said to be the knowledge pertaining to the first half of Alchemy. No other details are known.
876	It is said to be a skill that shoots water from the Cylinder. No other details are known.
877	A skill that stores the powers of magic such as Fireball, Thunder, or Ice Spear, in a crystal. This type of crystal can be used even by those who do not have the related skill, as long as they are equipped with a Cylinder. With higher rank, a better quality crystal can be produced and a shorter amount of time is spent casting when using the Mana Crystal. Although you can use your own magic to perform Mana Crystallization, it’s not recommended because of the difficulty in handling both Alchemy and your own magic simultaneously. (It would ultimately be subpar to using someone else’s magic.)
878	A skill that extracts the ingredient by separating a material into its basic elements. If successful, you can extract an ingredient required to make an item. If you look into making skills such as Weaving, Refining, and Handicraft, you can acquire a hint regarding the item you get when you fragmentize.
879	A skill that synthesizes multiple items to create a new item. The quality of items before you synthesize will determine the quality of items after. Although it's hard to predict item results, you can find synthesis recipes in books on Alchemy, which can teach you how to make exceptional items.
880	An indication of how much knowledge you have gained about Alchemy. Mastery of Alchemy will increase after becoming familiar with all the various known types of Alchemy, not just one type. The material and structural changes aren't easy to follow, but investing the effort to acquire the proper knowledge will result in optimum results in most skills that pertain to Alchemy.
881	A skill that allows you to blast a powerful stream of water using the Water Cannon Crystals in the Cylinder. Spinning at high speeds, the water deals significant damage and knocks down nearby opponents. (Opponents at a distance will only incur minor damage and will not be knocked down.) You can insert up to 5 crystals at a time, which could be shot all at once if the situation demands.

885	Summon Golem
886	With the use of Alchemy, Barrier Spikes are created to block opponent attacks. When you advance your rank, you can deal damage or attack opponents that are beyond the Barrier Spikes. Barrier Spikes are recommended when you are battling multiple opponents or have a friend that needs protection.
888	An innovative Alchemy skill that can create Golems by structurally changing the inside of a stone. This ancient skill developed by Fomor Alchemists was previously inimitable by terrestrial races until recent times. This process is many times more intricate than controlling a Golem.
893	A skill that allows you to blast a powerful stream of water by inserting Water Crystals in the Cylinder. Spinning at high speeds, the water deals significant damage and knocks down nearby opponents. (Opponents at a distance will only incur minor damage and will not be knocked down.) You can insert up to 5 crystals at a time, which could be shot all at once if the situation demands.
894	A skill that uses a steam oven to crystalize the power of magic such as Fireball, Thunder, or Ice Spear. These crystals can be used by anyone who is equipped with a Cylinder. At higher ranks, better-quality crystals can be produced and a shorter amount of time is spent casting when using the Mana Crystal. Although you can use your own magic to perform Mana Crystallization, it's not recommended because of the difficulty of handling both Alchemy and your own magic simultaneously. (Using someone else's magic will produce superior results.)
895	A skill that extracts the ingredient after fragmentizing a material in a dry oven. If you look into making skills such as Weaving, Refining, and Handicraft, you can acquire a hint regarding the item you get when you fragmentize.
896	A skill that produces a new item by synthesizing multiple items in a dry oven. The quality of items before you synthesize will determine the quality of items after. Although it's hard to predict item results, you can find synthesis recipes in books on Alchemy, which can teach you how to make exceptional items (e.g. Ice Mine).

With an intentional change of a material's composition, it is possible to create entirely new substances. Alchemists, through a long study of the effects of time on materials, are able to change the attributes of metals. With this skill, you will be able to transform common metals into rare and valuable ones. And, with luck, you might be able to create precious gems, such as diamonds, or new metals that are entirely new to Erinn. This skill can only be used at a Dry Oven.

Party Healing works the same way, except that it not only helps just one other person but all the members of the party to which the person belongs. In theory, Party Healing is very similar to Healing, as both skills can be upgraded to the point of mastery where the spell may provide increased defense from outside attacks, or increased magic attack power as more party members are healed. The one caveat is that the spell only recovers HP and does not help for healing injuries.

Only when enough energy has been gathered can this skill then be activated. As soon as the skill is activated, the energy begins to escape though, and since no further energy can be gathered, this skill should only be activated once an appropriate target has been spotted.

2890	Battlefield Overture
2891	Lullaby
2892	Vivace
2893	Enduring Melody
2894	Harvest Song
2895	March Song
2902	As history marched on, the Bards couldn't help but be dragged into Erinn's many wars. The songs they played to enhearten their comrades was passed along through the generations, and now these same songs are used to boost morale before a big battle. Thus, these songs earned the title Battlefield Overture.
2904	Vivace is a musical term that means 'fast tempo.' Musicians discovered that songs played at that tempo could heighten spellcasters' mental alacrity and, after some experimentation, discovered that Vivace music was able to confer such benefits upon Alchemists, Warriors, and Rangers as well.
2905	Music not only uplifts the soul, but the mind and body as well. A well-played Enduring Melody can even harden defenses and restore energy.
2906	Nothing makes the workday go by more quickly like a good song. During the long months of planting and harvesting, Bards developed a series of tunes that would uplift the workers' spirits and improve their crops. These songs came to be known as Harvest Songs.
2907	Carry a jaunty tune in your heart, and your footsteps become lighter. This is the concept behind the March Song--an energetic, cheerful melody that helps the Bard and his companions travel across the land more quickly.
2908	The Final Shot is a powerful ranged skill that sharpens your senses and lets you fire arrows at an extremely high velocity.  It also boosts the aiming speed of your ranged skills and allows you to take an opponent's arrows without staggering or getting knocked down. By clicking on a nearby location while holding the Shift key, you can also teleport to that location, dodging an enemy that is about to attack. However, teleporting reduces the skill duration, so it should be used carefully.

2917	An excellent Bard can use anything as an instrument, whether it's a weapon, a tool, or a monster's body. By striking an enemy just so, a Bard can spread the instrument's resonance through an enemy's whole being. Many well-mannered Bards refuse to do this, but others are exhilarated by the feeling of this resonance. Their targets are thrown into shock, and experience waves of pain as the blow continues to resonate through them.

2953	Lullabies are usually reserved for the ones you love; a true Bard can play a Lullaby for his worst enemy. In fact, enemies who hear the Lullaby can fall asleep in an instant, making it a useful song to play in a fight. Sleeping enemies are more sensitive to damage, but they won't stay asleep for long. Unfortunately, stronger enemies are more difficult to put to sleep.

4345	Bash can only be used when equipped with a Close Combat weapon. Sufficient training in the Smash and Combat Mastery skills is required before you can learn Bash.
4346	A warrior must not lose their will to fight, even when surrounded. Even if one possesses great physical strength, a lack of mental fortitude can keep them from attaining victory. Rage Impact unleashes waves of fighting spirit to overwhelm your opponents, stopping them in their tracks and providing an opening to take them down.\n

4360	This spell releases arrows of lightning. Not much is known about this spell.
4361	Using electricity as the medium, this magic creates a small lightning bolt that penetrates the target. While the lightning hits the target in the blink of an eye, the pain inflicted on the target is prolonged. Lightning bolt can be even more powerful when combined with the spells cast by other casters around you. It can also spread from the main target to other nearby enemies. Repeatedly preparing Lightning Bolt can reinforce such a chain reaction. Enhancement effects will be added to the maximum charge.

4367	This magic spell releases stinging ice shards. Not much is known about this spell.
4368	Icebolt is an offensive spell with ice properties. It uses mana to focus the moisture in the air on one point, rapidly freezing it. The sharp ice shards created through instant freezing are then successively fired at the enemy. Frozen ice shards can cause as much damage as a well-sharpened blade, and they also generate mana and reduce enemy movement speed. While the casting time is long, an Icebolt that has been prepared can be instantly fired at the enemy. It should be assumed that, when there are ice shards revolving around a caster, they can be fired at anytime. These fearsome Icebolts can hit an archer before he draws the bow string, repeatedly attacking the target before the pain has even had a chance to subside.

4408	Ranald gave you a book of Defense techniques after you ran an errand for him. With the knowledge it contains, you should be able to protect yourself.
4409	Counterattack allows you to turn your opponent's strength against them. This skill will greatly increase your abilities in close-range combat, as you'll be able to reflect almost any attack. The stronger your enemy's attack, the stronger your counterattack becomes. When you're equipped with knuckles, which are usually used by Fighters, you can attack with more agility.
4410	You can protect yourself from any attack of the enemy in close-quarter combat by using this Defense skill. Remember that, while Defense is a way to protect your body, it also lets you retaliate. Successfully defending yourself disrupts the enemy's flow of attacks, opening themselves up to your attack. If you determine that you are on the defensive during a battle due to the one-sided attack of the enemy, you can instantly turn the tide of the battle by using this skill. Don't be discouraged even if your enemy does not lose his flow of attack, but persistently lead him on to spend his energy. After tiring out the enemy, administer a quiet and calm strike. Defense is the most effective preparation for your attacks.

Also, the pet's defense and protection are greatly increased and protects the owner by taunting nearby enemies. However, these effects depend on the pet's stats and level as well as the Divine Link rank.

At their peak, dancers can use their fast feet to slip through an enemy's defenses. Enemies might even be entranced enough by the dance to be brought to their end with no resistance. That is why this particular set of footwork is called the "Dance of Death."

4731	To be a great Chain Slasher, you need to learn to control the Sluagh and the source of its power, the Dorcha.
4732	You can use the Chain Blade to manage your Dorcha. Practice this skill often, and its efficiency will increase. Practice makes perfect!
4733	The most rudimentary of Chain Blade attacks. It doesn't do great damage, but it does effectively increase your Dorcha. Attack speed varies depending on distance. If you defeat the enemy with a Lucky Finish, you'll gain 3 Dorcha. If you defeat the enemy with a Huge Lucky Finish, you'll gain the maximum amount of Dorcha possible!
4734	Among all the Chain Slash skills, this one attacks the fastest. With enough Dorcha, enemies will drop like flies whenever you use this attack!
4735	This skill makes you dart forward like an arrow, attacking nearby enemies and forcing them off to the side. It's perfect for an emergency escape, and your opponent won't know what hit 'em!
4736	A skill that pulls in a mass of enemies, pounds them, and then flings them away from you. This technique is especially awesome when combined with an AoE skill.
4737	This skill snatches up an enemy, rendering it helpless before the blows of your powerful attacks. While in your clutches, enemies cannot use magic or alchemy.
4738	A skill perfect for damaging multiple enemies simultaneously. You use this skill to knock them flat on the ground, then attack them at your leisure.
4739	With this skill, you convert HP into Dorcha. \nBe careful with this one; don't bleed yourself dry in your desire for Dorcha!
4740	Plant the Chain Blade in a target and pull yourself to that target in an instant! \nYou can use this skill even when you are stunned.
4741	Imbues the Chain Blade with Dorcha, and curses an enemy with the mark of death. Whenever that enemy takes a hit, a blast occurs, which attracts more monsters.\nThe one with the Death Mark receives increased damage, but don't rely on this fact, for the mark of death does not last forever.
4742	A skill that boosts Dorcha's efficiency by imbuing the will of the Sluagh itself right onto the surface of the Chain Blade!\nThus, the damage of Dorcha skills increases for a brief period of time.
4743	A skill to be used when your faith is as strong as steel, untarnished by the acid of doubt. It unleashes your accrued Bachram to deal powerful damage, and can only be used one time during each Bachram Boost. The number of uses cannot be stacked.
4744	To master Chain Slash, you must learn how it works. First, the Sluagh...\nThe Sluagh are restless spirits which can live within you, and their turbulent aggression will permeate your soul with darkness, known as Dorcha. But this does not have to be a bleak state of affairs, for you can harness this Dorcha to achieve your own ends, and hopefully they are noble ends! You consume Dorcha to perform Chain Slash skills, but to do that effectively, you'll need to call upon your own inner strength, known as Bachram. Since it is your own inner strength, Bachram keeps the hostile Sluagh spirit under control. As your Bachram gauge fills, it restores HP, MP, and Stamina, and it resets the cooldown of many skills. And finally, a Bachram Boost will quickly refuel your Dorcha. Now, go forth and Chain Slash!

You've learned to harmonize and control these powers, including power from another world, forming an all-new divinity. But since this transformation is powered by an otherworldly essence that clashes with the pure power of Erinn, you can only maintain the transformation for limited periods when in combat. While this transformation is maintained, you'll have access to new skills alongside your Alban Knight Crusader skills, though they'll be fueled by a different, otherworldly source.

5123	When otherworldly power clashes with power from the gods of Erinn, it creates a quick blast of power that can damage enemies. Charge the otherworldly power to amplify it, increasing its power and range. A longer charge results in higher damage, and increases the power of your next Nova Obliteration.
5124	This skill lets you instantly teleport your transformed body, vanishing from enemy sight even after they've seen you.
5125	While Divine Blast relies on the clashing of power from two worlds to deal damage, Nova Obliteration takes it a step further by fueling the clash with the essence of Erinn, causing a powerful echoing of power that releases in a massive explosion of energy. This explosion will be more powerful if you first use Divine Blast or Alban Knight Crusader skills to amplify it.

5277	A skill that pushes the limits of your fighting spirit. Teleport and strike consecutive powerful blows at your enemies. You can unleash a near-limitless flow of attacks while the skill is active and ignore enemy Heavy Stander effects. You can further enhance the skill using rage, which accumulates when you attack or are attacked, to deliver the next set of attacks even faster. You'll deal more damage when you attack with a two-handed sword, a two-handed axe, or a two-handed blunt weapon.

You can move around quickly up to three times, gathering up scattered enemies into a single spot each time. After each sweep, any Close Combat skill you use will be greatly amplified. You may take damage during your sweeps, but you won't get knocked down. The skill may be canceled if you're attacked before you can begin your sweep.

5297	Final Hit is a powerful skill effective for close-range combat. It envelopes your body in a battle aura that pushes the limits of physical capability. Attack an enemy while the skill is active to teleport to their location and unleash a near-limitless flow of attacks, even when you're attacked back. While Final Hit is active, the durability of your melee weapons will not be consumed, and your attacks will knock enemies down less than usual, allowing you to squeeze in more hits. This effect is maximized when you wield twin swords, making it so that enemies don't get knocked down at all. Just remember that even though you may feel powerful launching so many attacks, you're still vulnerable to danger. Be careful not to get yourself knocked out when facing enemies who possess powerful attacks.
5298	With twin swords equipped, talk to [Aodhan] in Emain Macha with the [Skills] keyword and then talk to [Nicca] at the Qilla Base Camp with the [Twin Sword] keyword. Then, go through [The True Purpose of the Twin Sword] quest.

5552	The Fynni are a type of fairy that freely roam the lands of Erinn. Although generally weak, some among them have taken to inhabiting the bodies of animals and monsters, with many subsequently finding themselves unable to escape. A Fynni trapped within the body of a monster for too long is a detriment to both its host and itself. However, someone able to wield the power of the Fynn can extract these trapped Fynni from their unfortunate situation. 'Fynni Catching' is a skill that draws out trapped Fynni in the form of Fynni Gems. The type and strength of the Fynni within these gems depend on the monster it was taken from. Monsters that contain a Fynni can be distinguished based on whether the Fynni Gem is visible.
5553	There are weakened Fynni inside the Fynni Gems you can obtain through Fynni Catching. Once the environment within the gem stabilizes and becomes comfortable, the Fynni within will be awakened as a pet. The process by which this happens is known as Fynni Blossoming. As you grow a gem to maturity in a Blossoming Cage installed on your Homestead, the Fynni inside will slowly wake and ready itself to emerge into the world again. Once it is ready, the Fynni Pet appears in a form it believes to be best suited to serve its owner and greets them with a hug. It can take a good while for a Fynni to finally awaken, so remember to be patient with them.
5554	Equipping a Fynn Bell while a pet is summoned will imbue the pet with a burst of Fynni power. Use this power wisely to unite the multiple Fynni in different pets within the main summoned pet. If a Fynn Sync is successful, the main summoned pet will receive the power of the Fynn to become an even more powerful pet than before. The more Fynni that successfully sync together, the stronger the Fynn Pet will become. Some speculate this is due to the Fynni's desire to grow ever more dependable, worthy of a place at their master's side.
5555	Equip a Fynn Bell and bring the power of the Fynn to bear as you fashion a variety of fun and mysterious items. From tasty snacks the Fynni are sure to love to strange items that enable extraordinary abilities, you and your pet will be able to enjoy life's great and small moments together.
5556	Fynn Beads are round, glimmering stones that fairies love, bearing a passing resemblance to gemstones. Fynn Beads impart the power of the Fynn while a Fynn Bell is equipped in order to restore the light and awaken hidden power. This process is known as Burnishing. Fynn Beads that have been awakened through Burnishing confer unique abilities, and pets equipped with Fynn Beads can draw on the power of the Fynn within the beads to manifest special powers.

6213	Fishing
6214	Fishing is the only way to pull a catch from the water. You need a pole and bait, but it takes more than just equipment to excel at it. One needs the skill to properly set the bait on the hook, judiciously choose the best places to fish, and have the patience to wait until the catch is completely hooked. Beyond those things, a good angler must know when, after an extended struggle, to swiftly pull the exhausted fish from the water.

6386	Elemental Instillment is a practice core to the identity of Elemental Knights. These martial invocations imbue a warrior's weapon with a variety of special effects, including a level of the instilled element and increased damage, as well as enabling spells to be readied while fighting. Imbuing one's weapon with fire-elemental energies grants normal attacks the ability to hit enemies in a larger area, as well as speeding the casting of fire magic and adding 5% of Max Damage to the caster's Magic Attack. The spell being readied during combat can be cast with Ctrl + Right Click. Spells cast in this manner are unaffected by the equipped weapon's Piercing stat, and their charge time cannot be reduced below 50%. The more adept one becomes at instilling an element, the faster the process will be, until it can be performed almost instantaneously. A small amount of MP and Stamina are required to maintain an Elemental Instillment.

6388	Elemental Instillment is a practice core to the identity of Elemental Knights. These martial invocations imbue a warrior's weapon with a variety of special effects, including a level of the instilled element, increased damage, and enabling spells to be readied while fighting. Imbuing one's weapon with lightning-elemental energies grants normal attacks the ability to ignore an enemy's Defense and Protection and partially negate the effects of the Heavy Stander effect, as well as speeding the casting of lightning magic and adding 5% of Max Damage to the caster's Magic Attack. The spell being readied during combat can be cast with Ctrl + Right Click. Spells cast in this manner are unaffected by the equipped weapon's Piercing stat, and their charge time cannot be reduced below 50%.

A small amount of MP and Stamina are required to maintain an Elemental Instillment.
6389	Maintaining a formidable defense is important when facing multiple enemies. Dauntless Defense is a powerful stance that keeps one's guard up even amid a flurry of blows, turning the tables to damage foes by exploiting the gaps in their offensive. The defensive effect relies on a warrior's proficiency with the Defense skill, while the counterattack damage grows with the number of attacks blocked (up to 3 times).
6390	A technique in which one leaps in to strike enemies with a weapon wreathed in flame, then bounds out of harm's way just as quickly through the use of the force generated by the explosion. Being aware of where one wishes to end up is crucial to the effective use of this skill. Developed as an outgrowth of the Assault Slash skill, it is influenced by the user's Assault Slash damage and range, and is augmented with different effects depending on the active Elemental Instillment.
6391	A technique in which one enhances the spin of their Windmill strike to freeze surrounding enemies, leaving them vulnerable to a follow-up attack. Enemies hit by this attack are left frozen for a time and take additional damage when the ice shatters. Developed as an outgrowth of the Windmill skill, it is influenced by the user's Windmill radius and damage, and is augmented with different effects depending on the active Elemental Instillment. Enemies that aren't knocked down and enemies that are have already been frozen by Shattering Windmill cannot be frozen.
6392	A technique in which one unleashes a powerful forward smash, striking all enemies in a line with a shower of electric energy. Developed as an outgrowth of the Smash skill, it is influenced by the user's Smash damage, with more damage added based on one's proficiency with this skill. It is augmented with different effects depending on the active Elemental Instillment.
6393	Raise the Elemental Knight Arcana to Level 8 or higher.
6394	Raise the Elemental Knight Arcana to Level 7 or higher and the Instill Flame Skill to Rank B or higher.

6397	Hand of Restoration can quickly restore the HP of even allies in critical condition. While it shares a basis and fundamentals with the Healing skill, its restorative potency has been substantially increased through the power of Arcana. Its full power is greatly influenced by the caster's Healing skill, with higher ranks of Healing further amplifying Hand of Restoration's potency.
6398	Echoes of Salvation restores the HP of all party members within range. While it shares many fundamental principles with the Party Healing skill, its restorative potency has been substantially increased through the power of Arcana. Its full power is greatly influenced by the Party Healing skill, with higher ranks of Party Healing amplifying Echoes of Salvation's potency. This spell also draws on Enduring Melody's power to instantly restore MP and Stamina, though with lesser effectiveness than the song itself.
6399	Voice of Vitality continuously restores the HP of all party members within range of the caster and increases their Elemental Resistance. The HP restored by each individual pulse may be small, but the power of Arcana lends the effect a considerable duration. Higher ranks of the Shield skills will further increase the Elemental Resistance granted by Voice of Vitality.
6400	Pulse of Purification creates a sanctified zone that sears enemies and restores the HP, MP, and Stamina of allies within the zone's radius. The intensity of the saintly energy continues to build, growing in power the longer the zone persists, until it is released in a powerful explosion when the zone disappears.
6401	Pall of Ruination drastically weakens enemies within range of the caster for a short time. While it shares a basis and fundamentals with the Music Buff skills, its effects have been greatly altered through the power of Arcana. Its power is greatly influenced by the Dance of Death and Fantastic Chorus skills, with higher ranks of both amplifying Pall of Ruination's effects.
6402	Blessing of Protection greatly bolsters the survivability of all party members within range of the caster for a short time. While it shares a basis and fundamentals with the Music Buff skills, its effects have been substantially enhanced through the power of Arcana. Its power is greatly influenced by the Enduring Melody skill, with higher ranks of Enduring Melody amplifying Blessing of Protection's effects.
6403	Hymn of Resurrection is a potent spell that uses the power of Arcana to simulate the reviving power of a Phoenix Feather. The effect has been magnified through a mastery of mana such that even from a great distance, it can restore an ally to consciousness. Its power is greatly influenced by the First Aid skill, with higher ranks of First Aid amplifying Hymn of Resurrection's potency.

6552	Hermetic Harmony
6553	When the fusion of Mana and Dorcha fails, they repel each other violently, releasing a massive amount of energy. Shadow Flare takes advantage of this effect by using an intentional incomplete fusion to release a mass of Mana and Dorcha at an enemy. This intense blast explodes when it hits its target, dealing great damage to any other enemies in its path.
6554	Harnesses the Sluagh's innate attraction to a being's internal darkness to create an intangible chain between the caster and the target, through which energy can flow. By channeling lightning elementals through it, the caster can deal continuous damage, while minimizing energy blowback. Once the chain is stable, it can maintain itself independently, allowing the caster to use other skills and take other actions.
6555	Traps enemies within a violent storm of Dorcha and ice elementals. A large vortex pulls enemies in and deals continuous damage to them for a set period of time. It's strong enough to trap enemies who've been knocked back by a different skill. During the storm's duration, there is nothing the enemy can do to escape; they must endure the storm's attack.
6556	Allows the Sluagh to absorb Dorcha and then release it as Mana. Some excess energy from the conversion remains around the caster, reacting to subsequent magic and Dark Diviner skills, and reducing their Mana consumption. As proficiency with the skill increases, the efficiency of the conversion also increases, allowing for a greater and longer-lasting decrease to Mana consumption.
6557	Channels stress and other negative emotional impacts of rapid Mana consumption, thus converting it into Dorcha. Since this method requires intentionally causing negative emotions in the caster for the Sluagh to consume, the higher Max MP the caster has, the more Mana must be used. While this method is less efficient than obtaining Dorcha by attacking enemies with magic or a chain blade, it does allow the caster to quickly replenish Dorcha in any situation.
6558	Blocks an enemy's connection to Mana and substitutes it with Dorcha. When the enemy attempts to use magic, it will be blocked and cause an incomplete fusion, resulting in an explosion which damages the enemy. As proficiency increases, it will become possible to block higher-level magic.
6559	Uses the combined effect of Mana and Dorcha to negate the effects of an enemy's Magic Defense and Magic Protection. Dorcha is released at the exact moment Mana is activated, minimizing the amount of time the Mana is surrounded by Dorcha and preventing fusion. When the Dorcha is released, a unique pattern is drawn, which the Mana passes through. As proficiency increases, the caster will be able to produce greater effects with less Dorcha.
6560	Releases a blast of concentrated heat into the air to burn all enemies within range. While the process of attaching a Fire Crystal to an arrow may not seem difficult, without a mastery over alchemy, one could easily lose control. This skill uses the exploding arrowhead mechanism of a Crash Shot, so it is affected by Crash Shot's fragment damage. To use, you will need Fire Crystals and crystals of one other element. (Crystals Needed: 5 Fire Crystals, 5 Crystals of a selected element)
6561	Through alchemical refinement, water can be condensed to such pressure that it is harder than standard arrowheads. Water Crystals made to these specifications are fused to arrows and sent soaring, attacking all enemies within a wide range. Can also be aimed in one direction to deal heavy damage. This skill uses the force of Magnum Shot, and so is affected by Magnum Shot's damage. To use, you will need Water Crystals and crystals of one other element. (Crystals Needed: 5 Water Crystals, 5 Crystals of a selected element)
6562	By attaching Wind Crystals to an arrow, creates a powerful current that pulls enemies along the path of the arrow. Though it does not last long, the wind currents are so powerful they are visible to the naked eye. To use, you will need Wind Crystals and crystals of one other element. (Crystals Needed: 5 Wind Crystals, 5 Crystals of a selected element)
6563	Affixes Earth Crystals to an arrow and fires. When the arrow hits an enemy, it sends shockwaves through the ground which periodically deals damage to nearby enemies as well. Since it has been strengthened by alchemy, the earth that is flung up by the shockwave has a hardness similar to steel. To use, you will need Earth Crystals and crystals of one other element. (Crystals Needed: 5 Earth Crystals, 5 Crystals of a selected element)
6564	Fires 3 arrows in succession, which pierce through all enemies in a straight line. As in many alchemy skills, any combination of elements can be used. At least 2 types of elemental energies must be completely filled to use this skill, and 2 types of Crystals are required. (Crystal Materials: 5 for each selected element)
6565	The foundation of all Alchemic Sharpshooter skills is the ability to infuse arrows with pure elemental energy drawn from alchemical crystals. The primary element determines the nature of the skill itself, while the secondary element adds an additional effect. Depending on the combination of elements chosen, one of six different reactions will be catalyzed. Proficiency in this skill is influenced by both Alchemic Sharpshooter proficiency and the Alchemy Mastery of each element used. Secondary elements can be added after selecting a skill by pressing the key corresponding to that element (1, 2, 3, or 4). 
6566	Raise the Dark Diviner Arcana to Level 1 or higher.

6589	Enchanting is the art of imbuing an object with magical effects. However, the scrolls that contain these enchantments can be fragile, and if used alone, may crumble to dust if the attempt fails. However, by learning the Enchant skill, you'll be able to use Magic Powder as a medium to transfer the effect from scroll to equipment, making such tragic outcomes far less commonplace. You can use the Enchant skill alone to attempt an Enchant, but seasoned enchanters recommend using the skill while holding a bottle of Magic Powder in your right hand and an Enchant Scroll in your left. If you choose to protect the Enchant Scroll, only the piece of equipment you're trying to enchant will be damaged in the event of a failed enchant attempt. On the other hand, if you choose to protect the equipment, the Enchant Scroll will absorb the brunt of a failed enchant attempt, destroying it.

6600	Fusion Bolt
6601	Fusion Bolt is an advanced technique which combines the powers of two different types of Bolt Magic. In the past, a true fusion could only be produced by two party members casting magic simultaneously. However, after much research, a method was discovered allowing a single person to accomplish the same feat. The simplest method is to start casting Bolt Magic with your currently equipped magic tool, and then to cast a different attribute before preparation is complete. However, skilled mages can begin casting a fusion immediately.
6602	Casts bolts that strike in quick succession. Charges increase spell radius and bolts fired.
6603	Casts multiple powerful bolts. Charges increase blast power and number of bolts fired.

6615	Lance Leap was devised to compensate for the weapon's inherent shortcoming of being unable to bring its full power to bear at close range. Skilled lancers saw the need for defensive maneuvers beyond simply the Lance Counter, a stance difficult to hold indefinitely in a pitched battle. The Lance Leap was devised as a means by which a combatant can open distance between themselves and their opponent, securing a more advantageous position from which to quickly launch their next big attack.
6616	Lance Impact strikes an enemy with a heavy blow, the force of which either knocks the foe back, or pushes the lancer away from them. Skilled lancers saw the need for a strong attack to supplement their Lance Charges, developing Lance Impact to take advantage of a lance's length and heft to simultaneously attack and open distance between themselves and their opponent. This allows a combatant to better avoid lances' limitations at close range.

6639	Counterattack allows a combatant to turn the strength of an opponent's blow against them. The effective use of this skill will greatly increase one's ability to stand their ground in a battle, allowing them to reflect almost any blow. The stronger the force behind an enemy's attack, the stronger the counterattack will be. Using Knuckles, a weapon favored by Fighters, allows you to utilize Counterattack even more nimbly.
6640	Bash can only be used when equipped with a Close Combat weapon. Sufficient training in the Smash and Combat Mastery skills is required before you can learn Bash.
6641	Achieve character level 100. If you are a novice without an active talent, try spending a little more time getting adjusted to the world.
6642	Counterattack allows a combatant to turn the strength of an opponent's blow against them.

The stronger the force behind an enemy's attack, the stronger the counterattack will be. Using Knuckles, a weapon favored by Fighters, allows you to utilize Counterattack even more nimbly.
6643	Bash's quick strikes provide a useful counterpoint to the slow but powerful blow of the Smash skill. It can be used to capitalize on an enemy's weakness, chaining progressively stronger hits together, as well as to quickly close the distance between a combatant and their foe. However, those who would employ Bash must also be wary of leaving themselves open, as the speed of its blows leaves the attacker open to a well-timed Counterattack or other defensive measures. One must also mind their Stamina so as not to overexert oneself and wind up exhausted at a critical moment. It is for these reasons that Bash is considered a skill only experienced warriors with considerable combat experience can utilize effectively.\n\nUsing Bash sets an aggressive tempo in battle, granting a combatant the ability to negate up to a certain level of auto-defense granted by an enemy's Heavy Stander passive skill. Warriors whose Bash energy has reached its peak will thus find that they deal increased damage with Close Combat skills and partially bypass foes' innate defenses. This increase in Close Combat skill damage also affects the base damage they contribute to any Arcana skills that draw upon them.

6749	A skill that transmits the force of an attack across a wide distance. One trained in the esoteric art of Battle Astrology uses their ability to sense the forces of cause and effect to bend the laws of causality. By opening a brief rift in subspace, the astrologer is able to inscribe the full force of their attack on the target as though the two were in close proximity.
6750	A skill that creates and detonates a condensed orb of stellar energy to scathe a large area. Battle Astrologers can conjure these starlike spheres and propel them to a location of their choosing. As the gravitational forces holding the orb together are dispelled, the energy is released in a violent blast, dealing great damage to surrounding foes.
6751	A skill that sends forth a shearing wave of stellar energy, striking all enemies in its path. The origins of this art are rooted in the concept of severing an entity from its fate, projecting a map of the constellations to guide the curved wave that rends those same links as it passes. The further the wave extends from its point of origin, the more its power will be diminished, until it eventually dissipates. By pressing and holding the skill's hotkey, you can extend the distance this skill can travel while retaining its full destructive power.
6752	A skill in which the user quickly spins as they dash toward a chosen point, swinging their scythe in an unbroken radial arc capable of striking any enemy in its path up to three times. This movement draws inspiration from the rotation of the celestial bodies, and combines both movement and offense in a gracefully aggressive assault.
6753	A skill that unleashes a quick burst of stellar energy accompanied by two proto-stars that quickly rotate around the caster. The surge of energy stuns the surrounding enemies as it passes through them, halting their attack while granting the astrologer an opportunity to take the offensive.
6754	A skill that draws upon the constellations to bathe the caster's surroundings in starlight, weakening enemies' attacks while restoring allies' HP. The power of these astrological signs exert their influence upon each individual's fortune, amplifying positive connections to the astrologer in the form of boons and positive effects while blunting the strength of those who bear them ill will.
6755	A skill that harnesses a potent gravitational fluctuation to quickly move to a desired location. The distance one can travel rapidly expands in the moments after the skill is cast.
6756	Astrology is a field of study that draws upon knowledge gleaned from observing the stars to divine the potential fates of those living in Erinn. One skilled in the astrologer's arts goes beyond mere prediction, becoming capable of directing the forces of cause and effect in battle. Astrologers determine the most successful course of action by reading the fortunes of allies and enemies alike through the use of tarot cards and observing the stars. They wield scythes in battle, symbolizing their ability to sever a foe's connection to blessings and good fortune, as well as stellar magic that deals potent damage that is difficult to avoid.
6757	A skill that calls upon an astrologer's sagacious knowledge of the heavens to augment the attributes of their skills. By altering the influence exerted by specific stars, they can modify the functionality of each of their abilities in a variety of ways. The representations of the stars in the constellations that govern each skill are known as 'Stella,' and depending on which Stella are most strongly expressed in the governing constellation, skills will take on one of four distinct aspects: Offense, Support, Control, or Fortune. As this skill redirects the influence of the stars themselves upon the astrologer, making changes to the Constellation Chart requires access to the Fatespinner apparatus in the Stellar Citadel. As one grows more adept in this skill, one will be able to place a greater number of Stella, as well as utilize more powerful Stella.
6758	Astrologers are trained to divine the workings of fate through several means, including the use of tarot cards to foresee the best courses of action in battle. Through the drawing of cards, they determine how to use their abilities to maximum effect to claim victory, as well as the most advantageous skill for a specific moment. Guided by Battle Astrology's focus on bending fate to one's advantage, the aptly named 'Hand of Destiny' involves selecting and arranging a hand of cards tailored to one's own preferences and propensities in battle.
6759	Tarot Cards serve as a medium through which astrologers are able to discern the influence of the stars on past, present, and future, but they also serve as a potent part of a Battle Astrologer's arsenal. When an astrologer has, through their actions, manifested the destiny with which the cards in their hand are linked, they can fling the cards at a foe in a powerful attack whose malefic energy is intended to direct the target's destiny toward ruin. Fate Foretold can be invoked after drawing each of the cards chosen for your hand via 'Hand of Destiny' at least once. The aspect of each card will confer bonus effects on this skill.
6760	A skill that grants one the ability to travel to the Stellar Citadel, a space only perceptible to those trained in the esoteric art of Battle Astrology. The growth of this skill represents a strengthening of one's connection to the citadel itself, granting an astrologer the ability to draw upon its currents of mana to bolster their own reserves.

6809	Allows the user to draw upon the residual potentialities of the stars' reflections to invest created objects with stellar energy. Drawing upon the great knowledge contained within the Stellar Citadel's Fatespinner, Astrologers make use of this discipline to craft the things needed for the practice of their art. No special equipment is required, but one must be near the Fatespinner in order to utilize this skill. As such creations require a vast amount of knowledge, some items require significant amounts of MP and Stamina to produce.
6810	A skill that showcases Astrologers' expert ability to harness celestial forces. Observing the stars reflected on a body of water, the user casts their line and draws in fragments of stellar energy. The greater one's knowledge of the constellations, the more effectively such energy can be harvested. As the stars' reflections must be visible to gather such energy, this skill can only be used at night.
6811	The art of reading a person's fate using a deck of tarot cards. The subject must focus on a possibility they're curious about or some question or topic on which they desire greater understanding, then select a card. If the destiny the card foretells isn't what you hoped for, there is no cause to fret--the future is never truly set in stone, and you may yet be able to receive the guidance of fate from another.
6812	A skill that draws upon Astrologers' knowledge of body and spirit, allowing them to capture an astral reflection of a subject's soul that preserves visual information about all aspects of their appearance. As the image reflects a singular point in time, it will not change even if the individual does. If there's anyone you wish to remember just the way they are, this is an excellent way to commit such fleeting moments to memory.
6813	A skill that allows an Astrologer to embellish the reflections captured with Astral Imaging. One can add stickers, borders, and backgrounds, customizing the details to create entirely unique designs for cards.

6843	세이크리드 가드는 견고한 의지와 고결한 울림을 내는 생명력을 기반으로 마나를 결정화하고, 이 결정을 모아 방패의 형상으로 빚어낸다. 이렇게 만들어진 결정과 방패는 세이크리드 가드가 사용하는 기술의 기반이 되며 다양한 형태로 완성된다.\n순간 도발은 스테인드글라스에서 쏟아진 빛이 바닥에 퍼지는 모습을 형상화한 기술로, 응집한 마나의 결정을 원하는 위치에 퍼뜨려 적의 시선을 빼앗는다. 작은 결정이 무형의 마나로 돌아가는 과정이기에 성역 전개만큼 넓은 범위에 영향을 줄 수는 없으나, 방패가 결정으로 돌아가는 과정이 없어 적의 시선을 즉각적으로 사로잡을 수 있다. 순간 도발에 직격당한 적에게는 세이크리드 가드의 마나가 덧씌워져, 일정 시간 동안 다른 순간 도발의 영향을 받지 않는다.\n*방어력은 방어와 보호, 마법방어와 마법보호를 총칭한다.
6844	세이크리드 가드는 견고한 의지와 고결한 울림을 내는 생명력을 기반으로 마나를 결정화하고, 이 결정을 모아 방패의 형상으로 빚어낸다. 이렇게 만들어진 결정과 방패는 세이크리드 가드가 사용하는 기술의 기반이 되며 다양한 형태로 완성된다.\n격돌은 두 다리에 마나를 강하게 응집하여 바닥을 박차 나감과 동시에 눈에 잔상조차 남지 않을 정도로 빠르게 돌진하여 적에게 방패를 충돌시키는 형태의 스킬이다. 적과 부딪치는 순간, 스테인드글라스가 팽창하는 것처럼 방패의 형상을 이루고 있던 힘이 터지며 순간적으로 공기가 밀려난다. 진공이 된 타격 지점으로 주변 대기가 빠르게 이동하며, 이 흐름에 일부 적이 해당 방향으로 다운된다. 매우 빠른 속도로 이동하는 스킬인 만큼, 대상과의 거리가 멀어질수록 몸의 균형이 무너져 재사용 대기시간이 늘어난다. 돌진을 응용한 기술이기에, 돌진 대미지의 영향을 받는다.\n*방어력은 방어와 보호, 마법방어와 마법보호를 총칭한다.
6845	세이크리드 가드는 견고한 의지와 고결한 울림을 내는 생명력을 기반으로 마나를 결정화하고, 이 결정을 모아 방패의 형상으로 빚어낸다. 이렇게 만들어진 결정과 방패는 세이크리드 가드가 사용하는 기술의 기반이 되며 다양한 형태로 완성된다.\n철벽 강타는 방패를 강하게 휘두르며 주변의 적을 공격하는 기술이다. 방패를 휘두를 때, 마나의 결합이 사용자의 근력을 버텨내지 못하고 끊어지는데, 그 충격으로 짧은 시간 동안 스테인드글라스의 빛무리와 같은 궤적이 만들어진다. 이 궤적에 흐르는 마나는 불규칙하게 움직이며 서로 부딪치고 결정으로 엉겨 짧은 시간 형태를 유지한다. 이때, 철벽 강타에 피격당해 빈틈이 생긴 적이 있으면 결정은 적의 빈틈을 파고들어 보호하는 능력을 방해한다. 철벽 강타에 여러 번 적중당한 적은 더 많은 결정의 영향을 받아, 그만큼 많은 양의 능력을 잃게 된다. 윈드밀을 응용한 기술인 만큼 사용자의 윈드밀 대미지의 영향을 받는다.\n*방어력은 방어와 보호, 마법방어와 마법보호를 총칭한다.

6847	세이크리드 가드는 견고한 의지와 고결한 울림을 내는 생명력을 기반으로 마나를 결정화하고, 이 결정을 모아 방패의 형상으로 빚어낸다. 이렇게 만들어진 결정과 방패는 세이크리드 가드가 사용하는 기술의 기반이 되며 다양한 형태로 완성된다.\n희생의 응징은 희생을 감내한 자가 사용하는 기술이다. 내면을 견고하게 다져 자신의 뜻을 완벽히 관철하고자 하는 의지가 방패의 형상에 덧씌워지며 마침내 가장 눈 부신 빛을 터뜨린다. 방패에 모여든 빛과 결정이 터져나가며 주변의 적에게 감내하고 있던 희생이 영향을 준다. 공격에 맞은 일부 적은 세이크리드 가드의 위세에 눌려 오랜 시간 경직된다. 누적된 희생은 세이크리드 가드의 강한 의지에 영향을 받아, 잠시 동안 적에게 더 강한 공격을 실을 수 있도록 그 성질이 변하고 증가한 대미지만큼 희생에서 소모된다. 매직 실드류의 스킬을 응용한 기술이기에, 매직 실드의 가장 긴 지속 시간의 영향을 받는다.\n*희생은 아군이 받은 대미지 중 대신 감내하게 된 수치다.\n*방어력은 방어와 보호, 마법방어와 마법보호를 총칭한다.
6848	세이크리드 가드는 견고한 의지와 고결한 울림을 내는 생명력을 기반으로 마나를 결정화하고, 이 결정을 모아 방패의 형상으로 빚어낸다. 이렇게 만들어진 결정과 방패는 세이크리드 가드가 사용하는 기술의 기반이 되며 다한 형태로 완성된다.\n고결한 희생은 아군이 받는 대미지의 일부를 대신 감당하여 아군이 전투에 집중할 수 있도록 보조하는 기술이다. 지킬 대상에게 마나의 결정을 보내 자신과 연결하고 희생의 가호를 부여한다. 희생의 가호가 적용되면 마나의 결정이 고리처럼 떠올라 주변을 감싸는 데, 적에게 공격을 받으면 그 피해의 일부를 시전자에게 전달하는 역할을 한다. 전달된 피해는 곧바로 시전자에게 적용되지 않고 희생에 누적되어 주기마다 일정 비율만큼 감소한다. 감소한 수치는 원래의 형태인 대미지로 전환되고, 세이크리드 가드보다 항상 앞에 있는 방패의 영향을 받아 그 수치가 방패의 대미지 감소 효과만큼 감소하게 된다.\n*희생은 아군이 받은 대미지 중 대신 감내하게 된 수치다.\n*던전, 그림자 미션 등을 클리어하면 스킬이 종료된다.

6907	셸 시프트는 탄환에 담긴 마력을 사용자의 마나 셸로 재가공하는 스킬로 생산된 마나 셸은 블래스트 랜서의 스킬을 사용하기 위한 동력으로 사용된다. 마나 셸로 재가공되는 과정에서 재료로 사용된 마력탄의 추가 효과는 사용자의 랜스에 스며들어 그 효과 또한 받게 되어 높은 품질의 마력탄을 사용할수록 더 높은 효과를 받는다.
6908	포커스드 엣지는 날카로운 랜스의 끝을 더욱 날카롭게 다시 한번 마나로 감싸 적을 공격하는 형태로 사용자의 스킬 랭크가 높을수록 스킬을 제약 없이 더 많이 사용할 수 있으며 적을 연이어 공격할수록 더욱 강하게 공격한다. 이 기술을 반복하여 사용하게 되면 무기가 받는 부담이 커지기 때문에 영속적으로 사용할 수는 없으며 사용 숙련도가 블래스트 랜서의 지구력을 결정짓는다.
6909	임팩트 크러시는 랜스를 땅에 강하게 내리치며 이때 충돌로 발생한 스파크로 랜스 전신에 담겨있던 마나에 폭발을 일으켜 적을 공격하는 기술이다. 자칫 잘못하면 주변뿐만 아니라 자신까지 위험하게 만드는 굉장히 위험한 기술이기 때문에 마나 셸을 다루는 솜씨가 능숙한 블래스트 랜서만이 가능한 기술이다.
6910	스파이럴 볼텍스는 랜스 전신에 담겨있던 마나를 고밀도로 압축한 다음 방출하며 얻은 동력으로 빠르게 주변을 공격하는 기술이다. 방출되는 마나의 압력을 자신의 의지대로 제어하는 것은 결코 쉬운 기술이 아니기 때문에 마나 셸을 다루는 솜씨가 능숙한 블래스트 랜서만이 가능한 기술이다.
6911	차지 어설트는 랜스 블로우에서 적을 강하게 찌르기 위해 순식간에 힘을 압축하던 기술을 마나 셸에 접목한 형태로 필요한 순간에 시전자가 순간적으로 압축된 마나 셸을 해제하여 강력한 추진력을 얻게 되어 고속으로 이동하게 되는 기술이다. 마나 셸을 순식간에 압축하기 위해선 많은 에너지가 요구되기 때문에 자주 사용할 수는 없지만 강력한 추진력을 얻은 블래스트 랜서는 이동하는 일직선상의 모든 적을 관통한다.
6912	오버 드라이브는 적을 향해 맹렬히 돌진하여 공격하는 랜스 차지의 추진력을 접목한 형태로 순식간에 압축된 마나를 상대방에게 찔러 넣어 폭발 시키는 기술이다. 순식간에 압축된 마나는 상대방을 공격할 때 발생한 강력한 충격으로 인해 통제되던 형태를 잃어버려 다시 팽창하게 되는데 이때 공격 대상을 중심으로 강력한 폭발이 발생한다. 랜스 차지를 응용한 기술인 만큼 사용자의 랜스 차지 대미지의 영향을 받는다. (과열 에너지를 50% 이상 보유하고 있는 경우, 일정 수준 이하의 헤비 스탠더 자동 방어 무시 적용)
6913	어나이얼레이션은 적을 향해 맹렬히 돌진하여 공격하는 랜스 차지의 추진력을 활용한 형태로 사용자의 모든 마나를 순식간에 압축시킨 뒤 상대방에게 찔러 넣어 폭발 시키는 기술이다. 순식간에 압축된 대량의 마나는 상대방을 공격할 때 방생한 강력한 충격으로 인해 통제되던 형태를 잃어버리게 되고 다시 팽창하는 과정에서 과열되어 있던 랜스의 높은 온도를 방출해 연쇄 반응을 일으켜 공격 대상을 중심으로 매우 강력한 폭발이 발생하게 되며 이때 발생한 화염은 거침없이 주변을 태워버린다. 랜스 차지를 응용한 기술인 만큼 사용자의 랜스 차지의 대미지 영향을 받는다.

6958	마나의 힘을 빌어 사람에게 필요한 생명력을 모으는 마법을 힐링 마법이라고 한다. 특히 파티 힐링은 힐링 마법과 동일한 원리의 마법으로, 어느 한 개인이 아닌, 자신이 속한 파티의 동료들의 생명력을 회복시킨다는 점에서 일반적인 힐링 마법과 다르다. 파티의 동료 모두의 생명력을 회복시킬 수 있는 것은 이 마법을 가진 자만의 특권이라고 할 수 있다. 모험을 떠나는 길에 자신의 동료들의 생명력 유지를 책임지는 사람으로서 받는 존경의 눈길에 대한 보답은 그 특권에 따르는 책임이기도 하다. 사실 파티 힐링 마법은 힐링 마법과 이론상 닮은 부분이 많기 때문에 마법을 준비하는 시전자가 외부로부터의 공격에 대해 방어효과를 가지거나, 더 많은 사람들의 생명력을 회복할수록 더 쉽게 마법을 향상시킬 수 있는 점에서도 역시 공통점을 보인다. 하지만 이러한 공통점은 마법이 회복시키는 것은 생명력 뿐, 상처를 치료하지는 못한다는 점에도 마찬가지기 때문에 주의할 필요가 있다.
6959	신성한 힘으로 서로의 영혼을 연결하는 스킬이다. 신의 힘으로 연결된 영혼들은 교감을 통해 서로의 기억과 경험을 공유하며, 내면에 잠재되어 있던 힘을 한계까지 발휘할 수 있게 된다. 보통 영혼을 연결하기 위해 특별한 매개체를 필요로 하나, 자신의 펫을 대상으로는 이러한 제약 없이 스킬을 사용할 수 있다. 영혼이 연결된 펫과 시전자는 여러 능력치가 상승하며 펫은 시전자가 적을 처치하여 얻은 경험치를 동일하게 얻을 수 있다. 또한 펫은 방어와 보호가 크게 증가한 채로 시전자를 인식한 적의 주의를 끌어 적으로부터 주인을 보호한다. 단, 이러한 효과들은 펫의 능력치와 레벨, 디바인 링크 랭크에 영향을 받으므로 이를 유념하도록 하자.

6975	둘도 없는 인연을 만들고 받은 선물. 몸에 뿌려진 출처를 알 수 없는 마법의 가루는 원할 때 마다 몸 전체에 감돌며 하늘에서의 자유를 느낄 수 있게 해준다. 남의 도움을 받거나 누군가에 의지하는 것이 아니라, 스스로의 의지로 자유롭게 하늘을 누비는 기분을 마음껏 만끽 해보자.\n날고 있는 상태에서 상대방을 우클릭 하면 나타나는 날기 요청 메뉴를 이용하여 상대방이 승낙 하면 함께 나란히 하늘을 날아다닐 수 있다. 추억을 되살리며 상대방의 손을 잡고 허공으로 이끌 수 있다. 친구, 연인과 함께 자유롭게 날아보자.
6992	엘레멘탈 인젝션
6993	라인 브레이크
6994	엘레멘탈 인젝션은 장비하고 있는 근접 재능 무기에 각종 엘레멘탈을 부여하여 불/얼음/전기 속성의 한 단계 증가와 대미지 향상 외에도 각종 마법을 동시에 시전할 수 있게 하는 등 여러 특별한 효과를 만들어내는 엘레멘탈 나이트의 아이덴티티와도 같은 기술이다. 엘레멘탈 인젝션을 활성화할 경우, 일반 공격 시 넓은 범위의 적을 한 번에 공격할 수 있으며, 공격한 대상의 이동 속도와 공격 속도를 늦추고, 상대의 방어와 보호, 그리고 헤비 스탠더 효과를 일정량 무시할 수 있다. 불/얼음/전기 속성 마법 사용 시 시전 속도 상승과 함께 최대 대미지의 5% 만큼 마법 공격력이 상승되어 적용된다. 동시 시전한 마법은 Ctrl+우클릭으로 사용할 수 있으며 무기의 피어싱 효과를 받을 수 없다. 또한 시전 시간은 50% 이하로는 줄어들지 않는다. 숙련될수록 엘레멘탈을 부여하는 속도가 빨라진다.
6995	근접 전투로 단련된 신체에서 나오는 폭발적인 추진력으로 돌진하며 전방의 적을 공격한다. 근접 전투 재능 스킬인 배쉬의 추진력을 활용할 수 있기에 배쉬를 사용하면 라인 브레이크의 쿨타임이 줄어든다. 전투 흐름을 선도하는 배쉬 특유의 기운이 있는 상태라면 이 기운을 소비하여 라인 브레이크를 사용할 수 없는 동안 강제로 스킬을 한번 더 사용할 수 있다. 배쉬에서 파생된 기술인 라인 브레이크를 사용하는 동안은 배쉬의 헤비 스텐더 무시 효과가 상시 적용되며 이동 거리는 배쉬 이동 거리 증가 효과를 적용 받는다. 이러한 특징을 활용하여 높은 기동성을 토대로 적의 치명적인 공격을 회피하거나 적의 헛점을 노려 순식간에 강력한 공격을 퍼부울 수 있다.
6996	​엘레멘탈 나이트의 아르카나 레벨을 8 이상으로 올린다.
7013	어드밴스드 디펜스
7014	파이어 리프 어택
7015	아이스 윈드밀
7016	라이트닝 스매시
7017	다수와의 전투 중에는 수비 자세를 계속 유지할 수 있는 능력도 필요하다. 어드밴스드 디펜스는 적의 맹공 속에서도 디펜스 상태를 계속 유지, 그리고 찰나의 빈틈을 노려 주변의 적들에게 피해를 줄 수 있는 기술이다. 방어 성공 효과는 스킬의 숙련도와 사용자가 수련한 디펜스 스킬의 효과에 따르며, 방어에 성공했을 시 받은 피해를 이용하여 반격 대미지가 달라진다. 반격에 성공한다면 발생한 에너지를 마나와 스태미나로 치환하여 일정량 회복할 수 있다. 디펜스 스킬에서 파생된 스킬이기 때문에 디펜스로 막을 수 없는 공격에 대해서는 대미지 감소 효과가 적용되지 않는다.
7018	빠르게 날아올라 적들을 타격하고 빠르게 후퇴하는, 강력함과 기동성을 동시에 갖춘 기술. 다운 어택을 응용한 이 기술을 사용하면 크게 점프하여 대상과 주변을 화염으로 휩싸인 무기로 공격 후 그 폭발을 이용해 다시 원하는 위치로 튕겨나가듯 빠르게 이동할 수 있다. 기술이 발동된 후 폭발이 일어나기 전의 짧은 순간에 퇴각 위치를 선택하는 것이 중요하다. 다운 어택을 응용한 기술인 만큼 사용자의 다운 어택 대미지와 공격 가능 거리의 영향을 받으며, 엘레멘탈 인젝션이 활성화된 상태에서는 추가적인 효과가 발휘된다.
7019	둘러싼 적을 윈드밀로 1차 공격과 함께 얼어붙게 만들어 후속 공격을 이어갈 수 있게 만드는 기술. 공격을 받은 적들은 일정 시간 얼어붙었다가 얼음이 깨질 때 추가 대미지를 입는다. 윈드밀을 응용한 기술인 만큼 사용자의 윈드밀 범위와 대미지의 영향을 받으며, 엘레멘탈 인젝션이 활성화된 상태에서는 추가적인 효과가 발휘된다. 넘어지지 않는 적들은 얼지 않으며 이미 아이스 윈드밀로 얼어붙은 적 또한 같은 스킬로 다시 얼릴 수 없다.
7020	라이트닝 엘레멘탈이 실린 무기로 스매시를 시전해 전방의 적들에게 번개를 내리치는 기술. 스매시를 응용한 기술인 만큼 사용자의 스매시 대미지의 영향을 받으며 이 기술의 숙련 정도에 따른 대미지가 추가된다. 엘레멘탈 인젝션이 활성화된 상태에서는 추가적인 효과가 발휘된다.
7021	엘레멘탈 나이트의 아르카나 레벨을 8 이상으로 올린다.
7022	엘레멘탈 나이트의 아르카나 레벨을 7 이상, 엘레멘탈 인젝션 : 파이어 스킬의 랭크를 B 랭크 이상으로 올린다.
