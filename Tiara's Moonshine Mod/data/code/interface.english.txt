pli_windowwinehelpview.9	Aging is an important factor in assessing the value of wine.\n\n<color=2><outlinecolor=3>The longer the aging process,</outlinecolor></color>the higher the value of the wine.
pli_windowwinehelpview.10	When 24 hours (in real time) have passed, the freshness of the wine starts to decrease.\n\nIn order to prevent the loss of freshness,\n<color=2><outlinecolor=3>the Oak Barrel must be replaced</outlinecolor></color>on a regular basis.
pli_windowwinehelpview.11	Replacing the Oak Barrel gets more difficult each time it is performed. As a result, changing the Oak Barrel too often will make it difficult to age the wine for a long time. The best method <color=2><outlinecolor=3>is to replace the barrel</outlinecolor></color> every 24 hours.
pli_windowwinehelpview.12	During the aging process, sediments will appear in the wine. In order to maintain the purity of the wine, whenever the Oak Barrel is replaced, <color=2><outlinecolor=3>the sediments should be removed</outlinecolor></color> as well.
pli_windowwinehelpview.13	During the removal of the sediments, the wine will be exposed to air, which will cause oxidation. If the process takes too long, the wine will develop a sour taste and the quality will decrease. As a result, the sediment removal process should be conducted <color=2><outlinecolor=3>as fast</outlinecolor></color> as possible.
