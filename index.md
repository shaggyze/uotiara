>>To restore things, find the corresponding files in the data folder (or whatever directory you use) and delete/remove/replace to modify them to fit your preferences, delete uotiara.pack in the package folder or use the installer/uninstaller.


>>To change the font, go to the data folder, open the gfx folder, open the font folder, then replace the nanumgothicbold file with a truetype font file(.ttf) of your choosing.


Note: The new font file must be renamed "nanumgothicbold.ttf" to function. If there is no nanumgothicbold.ttf-named file at all or a file other than nanumgothicbold.ttf, the default mabinogi font will be used. If you are using a dll patcher that uses Bitmap font or BitmapPositionFix, then nanumgothicbold.ttf will be undetected and font_eng.dds will be read instead.


>>Frequently asked questions<<
If you get PACK malformated or a 'delete etc language.Package' error then delete language.pack from the package folder then run mabinogi.exe to download a new language.pack and it should let you apply mods again.


To Remove Graphic Always Noon Sky:
Find these 3 mods in the installer and uncheck. If you use abyss/kanan you can delete the files manually and if you use mabipacker/UOTiaraPack.bat delete UOTiara.pack in package folder.
